## Guidelines

Contributions require approval, but requirements are light and expectations are low.

For edits, positive technical changes like fixing typos or grammar, updating links, or adding relevant footnotes will all be approved eventually. Changes to the content itself is subject to the approval of the relevant authors.

For new additions, as long as you put in enough effort for others to get the gist of your content, and what you create fits in the world and isn't awful, it'll get approved.

The world is big, so it's not hard to fit in it. Some examples of things that wouldn't fit, however, would be things like new gods, people or technology from another planet, magic that doesn't follow established rules, or events that contradict established history. Of course, what is currently established could change to suit what you want to add, provided that the changes are also met with the needed approval.

As for what "awful" means, there are two main parts. First would be things that aren't believable, like a character that never experiences failure or rejection, or has no drawbacks. Second would be anything that can be considered hateful or offensive *with no believable in-world reason to exist.*

Additionally, if what you intend to create will *directly reference*, or be used to *actively promote* **real-world** politics, ideologies, religious beliefs, or violence, it will be rejected. This is universal and non-negotiable.

Basically, be cool and stay true to the fiction, and you'll probably be fine.

Be sure to also look over the meta notes, as they contain valuable real-world points of comparison for creators, like [[On the languages of the world|how to handle foreign language]], [[Using mystic matter and magic|using mystic matter and attunement]], and [[Appropriate real-world influences|where to draw and apply real-world influences]].

## How to contribute

This entire wiki is written with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) in mind, and readability is focused on Obsidian first. I highly recommend that anyone who wishes to contribute to this wiki use Obsidian to do so. With that said, it is not a requirement and you are free to use whatever method you want to contribute to this wiki.

Another thing to keep in mind is that your contributions to this wiki will automatically be licensed under [Creative Commons CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) by default, like everything else. You can instead choose to use a different license for your contributions by including it on your pages or in their metadata, and if you make it easy for others to contact you, you can make separate agreements with individuals as well. For instance, using a non-commercial license publicly, but separately allowing commercial usage only with your explicit permission.

I *strongly* suggest that if you choose to use another license, you use another [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) license. You can try another license if you really want to though. With that in mind, I am very critical of copyright and want this world to remain fully open, so "All Rights Reserved" will never be accepted on this wiki. Restrictions may be applied, but *all* content on this wiki *must* remain free to use.

## Style guide

In an attempt to keep this wiki looking somewhat consistent, here are some guidelines on how to actually write stuff.

##### Links

When another article is mentioned in any article, or you want to link to an external page somewhere on the internet for any reason, link to it at the first mention. Unless you have a very specific reason, try not to link to the same thing more than once in the same article.

##### Spelling

American English spelling is expected to be used on all canon articles. The only situation where British English spelling should be used instead is in the context of names, items, quotes, and stories originating from or set in areas of the world that would use it.

##### Punctuation

Yes, I put this entire subheading here just to tell you to use double quotation marks instead of single, avoid exclamation marks entirely (outside of quoted dialogue) if possible, and use the oxford comma.

##### Voice

Something something passive voice bad, third grade English teacher.

To be frank, I don't care whether or not you use the active voice or the passive voice, all I care about is that the information is conveyed. If you want to edit things written in the passive voice into the active voice, I won't stop you, but I'm also not going to stop anyone else from writing in the passive voice in the first place. Go wild.

##### Tense

Everything should be written in the past tense. All articles here are written with the assumption that "current time" is the end of the year 2033. There is nothing beyond that point, and nothing taking place actively at that time, and that's by design.

##### Numbers

In prose, all numbers less than 11 should be spelled out, and all numbers greater than ten should be shown numerically. Exceptions include:
- General, non-exact numbers at and beyond the million (X million/billion/etc)
- The passage of time (7 minutes, 3 days, etc)
- Dates, times, and coordinates

##### Pronouns

Third-person pronouns should be always be used in all articles unless explicitly referring to the reader, or yourself as the author, both of which you should try to avoid doing anyway. Whenever a character's gender is uncertain, use the singular "they" and "themself" to refer to them.

##### Formality

Formal use of language is preferred for most things, but far from mandatory. You should aim to write as formally and impartially as possible, but don't overthink it if that will hold you back. Just remember that everything written here should be presented as though this world was the real world, and this wiki describes it to its people.

##### Capitalization

Both in article titles and inside the articles themselves, unnecessary capitalization should be avoided. Capitalization should be reserved exclusively for proper nouns, the start of sentences, and in-world titles. For example:
	*...they fought in the Siege of Soukotan.* ✔️
	*...they fought in The Siege of Soukotan.* ❌
	*...they fought in the siege of Soukotan.* ❌

##### Italics

In-world media and works of art of any kind should *always* be italicized. The names of historical events, organizations, or other articles should *never* be italicized. As you can see here, using italics for emphasis is also acceptable, and you should do that rather than using boldface, but ideally your sentences should be explicit enough to not need emphasis at all.

##### Admonitions

There are four admonition templates available to insert eye-catching colored text boxes into articles, and this is how they should primarily be used:

<div style="background-color:b6d0e2; border-left:4px solid #4169e1; line-height:18px; padding:12px">
	<div style="color:black"><b>Note: </b>Use this admonition to provide any in-world information you believe readers need to know that isn't directly relevant enough to be included in the article itself.</div>
</div>
<br>
<div style="background-color:e6e6fa; border-left:4px solid #7f00ff; line-height:18px; padding:12px">
	<div style="color:black"><b>Meta: </b>Use this admonition whenever you want to provide real-world information as relevant context for something in an article.</div>
</div>
<br>
<div style="background-color:eecccc; border-left:4px solid #ff2400; line-height:18px; padding:12px">
	<div style="color:black"><b>Warning: </b>Use this admonition to point out things that are important to consider as a creator. For example, when only a handful of characters should know something.</div>
</div>
<br>
<div style="background-color:fffdd0; border-left:4px solid #fdda0d; line-height:18px; padding:12px">
	<div style="color:black"><b>Issue: </b>Use this admonition to point out where and how something may be incomplete, unfitting, in need editing, or otherwise questionable in any way.</div>
</div>

You may change the boldfaced first word if you feel another word would fit better for your intended purpose, but please stay consistent to the intended purpose of these colors.

Bear in mind that Markdown and wikilinks will not function inside these boxes, only HTML, and relative file paths do not function in HTML inside of Obsidian. Line breaks also require HTML to function inside them.
