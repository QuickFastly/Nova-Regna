Shun Inazuma is a [[Fox|fox spirit]], and one of two surviving members of the [[Inazuma Clan]]. Together with his wife, [[Nori Inazuma]], he traveled the world for several centuries and appears in many disparate historical events as a result. He currently lives in rural [[Shiga]] in [[Onsai]], [[Shinzen]].

## Physical description

He has brilliant blue eyes, jet black hair and fur, very large and somewhat rough fox ears and tail, digitigrade feet, retractable claw-like fingernails, leather bracers, a sleeveless floral kimono-style top, and baggy pants tied around the ankles. More detail TBD

He lost his right arm entirely in (year).

## Special abilities

Like all fox spirits, he has both [[Alignment]] and [[Attunement]]. He was a master of the traditional Inazuma sword arts despite only receiving one short year of training from another master, and mastered them with the standard right handed technique despite being left handed. This combined with his ability to slow his perception of time and force his body to move proportionally faster made him one of the most feared swordmasters of Shinzen.

After losing his right arm, he immediately displayed an even more fearsome mastery of left handed swordsmanship by combining the Inazuma sword arts with a traditional sword and swordsmanship of his homeland of [[Shaohou]]. He never drew a sword again since then.

## Personality

Shun is a mischievous and curious person. He takes nothing seriously, no matter what it is, and can come off as rude and disrespectful as a result, but his actions show his deep compassion for others much more obviously than his words.

While it is typical for fox spirits to think very little of gender roles and expectations, and most of the world is aware of that and treats them appropriately, Shun was raised with an acute awareness of traditional gender roles and enjoys taking full advantage of that common belief to tease and manipulate others, and will respond the same way to any pronouns or gendered treatment. His only preference is that he be called Nori's husband, not her wife, out of respect to her.

## Relationships

He has been married to Nori Inazuma for centuries. Based on recent findings in the re-evaluation of the history surrounding them, it seems likely that they are also fourth cousins, three times removed despite their similar ages.

## History

He was born in [[Taihua]], [[Yuezou]], Shaohou to a Shisuya mother and Yao father, the names of both unknown, but history suggests that his mother was the third daughter of the first Inazuma. According to Shun, his mother raised him as a daughter to protect him from the rulers of the time, and it was her that taught him swordsmanship in secret and crafted the Shaohan sword he still holds today. He was sent away on his long solitary journey eastward through Shinzen by his mother after the rulers discovered that she was hiding Shun's true nature from them.
