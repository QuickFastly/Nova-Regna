Shun Inazuma is a [[Fox|fox spirit]], and one of two surviving members of the [[Inazuma Clan]]. Together with their wife, [[Nori Inazuma]], they traveled the world for several centuries and appear in many disparate historical events as a result. They currently live in rural [[Shiga]] in [[Onsai]], [[Shinzen]].

## Physical description

They have brilliant blue eyes, jet black hair and fur, very large and somewhat rough fox ears and tail, digitigrade feet, retractable claw-like fingernails, leather bracers, a sleeveless floral kimono-style top, and baggy pants tied around the ankles.

More detail TBD

They lost their right arm entirely in (year).

## Special abilities

Like all fox spirits, they have both [[Alignment]] and [[Attunement]]. They were a master of the traditional Inazuma sword arts despite only receiving one short year of training from another master, and mastered them with the standard right handed technique despite being left handed. This combined with their ability to slow their perception of time and force their body to move proportionally faster made them one of the most feared swordmasters of Shinzen.

After losing their right arm, they immediately displayed an even more fearsome mastery of left handed swordsmanship by combining the Inazuma sword arts with a traditional sword and swordsmanship of their homeland of [[Shaohou]]. They never drew a sword again since then.

## Personality

Shun is a mischievous and curious person. They take nothing seriously, no matter what it is, and can come off as rude and disrespectful as a result, but their actions show their deep compassion for others much more obviously than their words.

While it is typical for fox spirits to think very little of gender roles and expectations, and most of the world is aware of that and treats them appropriately, Shun was raised with an acute awareness of traditional gender roles and enjoys taking full advantage of that common belief to tease and manipulate others, and will respond the same way to any pronouns or gendered treatment. Their only preference is that they be called Nori's husband, not her wife, out of respect to her.

## Relationships

They have been married to Nori Inazuma for centuries.

## History

They were born in [[Taihua]], [[Yuezou]], Shaohou, to a [[Shisuya]] mother and [[Yinsha#Yao people|Yao]] father, the names of both unknown, but history suggests that their mother was the third daughter of the first Inazuma. According to Shun, their mother raised them as a daughter to protect them from the rulers of the time, and it was her that taught them swordsmanship in secret and crafted the Shaohan sword they still hold today. They were sent away on their long solitary journey eastward through Shinzen by their mother after the rulers discovered that she was hiding Shun's true nature from them.
