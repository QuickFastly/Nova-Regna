Goddess of love and prosperity. She is a shapeshifter and uses false names often. She is cheerful, compassionate and motherly, and very passionate and dedicated to her cause, to bring prosperity wherever she goes and leave peace and love in her wake. 

She creates butterflies much like the one that's part of Kerosyn out of origami. They glow the same white, but don't carry the same power as his does. That's not to say they're weak, though, because they are capable of both direct and indirect manipulation of people's thoughts, feelings, even personalities, to the point that these glowing butterflies have become a globally known legend associated with great change. She makes and releases one per day to bless whoever it happens to find, and will make additional ones when needed to accomplish specific things.
