Dvalinn is a [[Deer|Deer spirit]] and one of the five mortal [[Incarnations]]. He is loyal to [[Freya]] and the [[Risky Witches]], and participated in [[The Big Event]].

## Summary

As a mortal incarnation, Dvalinn has been several people throughout history. Every incarnation of Dvalinn shares a number of constant traits, including whitetail antlers - something no other deer spirits have - eyes that never open until adulthood, and extreme cataracts. Despite this, they can "see" everything around them thanks to their [[Alignment]], which also grants them a 360 degree field of vision and the ability to see around corners. They also possess [[Attunement]], manifesting as near total dominion over flora and fauna. Dvalinn always turns to the fringe faction of deer spirits, but typically maintains a pacifist approach to their cause. Should they resort to violence, however, their ability to twist and bend the land to their will can be terrifyingly effective.

Aside from this summary, the rest of this page applies only to the current incarnation of Dvalinn.

> [!bug] Issue
> The whole physical description heading is old info that I won't be bothering to update until I get a visual representation of him, which may look quite different. At that point, this section of the page will be updated with proper formatting based on that.

## Special abilities

His alignment grants him what is effectively 360 degree vision and the ability to see around corners. Though, being blind from birth, he does not see anything the same as a sighted person would. Vision through alignment also allows him to see unimpeded in darkness, and with his eyes closed or covered.

His attunement primarily manifests as near total dominion over flora and fauna, allowing him to control, manipulate, and weaponize any and all living things - excluding humans and spirits - within a radius of at least 20 kilometers. Within visual range, he can also manipulate and weaponize air, water, and the earth, appearing to use his staff as a focus of sorts.

Both of these things also grant him a certain closeness with the natural world. He cannot converse with animals or read their thoughts, and he cannot speak to plants, but he experiences an intuitive sense of their conditions, which allows him a level of understanding and compassion towards nature that very few others can achieve.

As an incarnation, his attunement also gives him drastically increased physical durability and resistance, allowing him to survive without food or water for long periods of time, resist diseases and poisons, and bear extreme heat or cold without issue.

## Personality

Dvalinn is a stoic, cold, mysterious type of guy, seemingly unconcerned with the people of the world, and he radiates an aura of serenity and elegance. At least, that's what he wants you to think.

In truth, Dvalinn is a very timid person with social difficulties thanks to having spent most of his life isolated deep in the woods. He is very uptight, has an inflated sense of self-importance, and delusions of grandeur, but lacks the social experience to assert himself, so he is very easily flustered and is surprisingly delicate, especially around women, even more so when they are taller than he is.

The one area where he exhibits full confidence is on the topic of nature. Being part of the fringe faction of deer spirits, his reverence for nature and desire to see it protected is a core part of him, and he will not hesitate to silence anyone he sees as an enemy to nature, be it with words, or through terror.

### Motivation

Dvalinn is concerned primarily with the preservation of undisturbed forests around the world, with the safety and prosperity of deer spirits being a distant second. He is an odd mixture of conflicting extremes, preferring to avoid violence entirely at all times while still being willing to inflict extreme and vicious violence on the enemy. On his own, when he encounters people wandering into his forest or camping, he will peacefully guide them out and instruct them to stay out, be it kindly or frightfully. But when loggers, city planners, developers, builders, hunters, poachers, or anything similar find their way into his forest, they are never heard from again.

With enough convincing, Freya took advantage of his violent heart to sway him to join the Risky Witches with the promise that by protecting deer spirits with the group, they will go on to protect the forests themselves. While he still does what he can to protect forests personally, he now finds pleasure in combat.

## Relationships

Dvalinn was the most difficult of the incarnations for Freya to recruit due to having no particular attachment to the outside world or the people in it, and he remains the most distant from her in the group, mostly treating her as a superior rather than a friend.

He has a rather sour relationship with [[Garm]] because of her constant bullying and pestering, but still tries to treat her with respect. He views [[Kuhai]] as little more than a colleague and mostly treats her as such. He enjoys speaking with [[Neven]] when she's alone, but finds her annoying when others are around. He is closest with [[Haida]] and deeply values her wisdom, showing her the most respect in the group.

In truth, he is quite bad at hiding his true feelings, especially when teased about them. While it's true that he was distant at first, over time he did grow very close with everyone in the group and would do a lot for them, but he will never admit that to anyone.

### Affiliations

He is a member of the Risky Witches [[Risky Witches#Special forces|Task Force 5555]] with the effective rank of O-6.

## History

sorry nothing

## Trivia

- Being so uptight, trying so hard to act mysterious and noble, being the only man among the incarnations, there are plenty of fitting reasons for his "Princess" nickname. As for its real origin, it came from Freya teasing him about the flowers on his antlers.
- Being blind from birth, yet still able to see thanks to his alignment, Dvalinn has a strange relationship with color. He knows what basic colors are, and what colors many things are meant to be, but does not actually know what color looks like to a sighted person.
