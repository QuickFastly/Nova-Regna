<span style="float:right; clear:right; width:260px; margin:14px 0px 7px 14px; text-align:center; font-size:small">![[freya ref (madbuns).jpg]]<br>First Freya reference - <i>Artist: <a href=https://twitter.com/Mad_buns>Madbuns</a></i></span>

Freya is a [[Cat|cat spirit]] and one of the three immortal [[Incarnations]]. She is one of the three deities of the [[Children of the Flame]], along with [[Florian]] and [[Kerosyn]]. She is also the leader of the [[Risky Witches]] and was responsible for [[The Big Event]].

## Physical description

Freya is a very tall, caramel skinned woman with an athletic, pear shaped build. She has sharp, narrow, bright yellow eyes with vertical pupils that have a subtle glow, with wrinkles and dark rings underneath. She also has sharp pointed teeth, long and subtly pointed fingernails capable of extending and morphing into cat claws, and two long black cat tails with white tips, matching her short and messy hair.

The [[The Brand (Children of the Flame).png|Brand]] is burned into her back in white with a red outline. It glows just bright enough to shine through one layer of clothing in daylight, and it stands out strongly in the dark unless covered.

Four blue flame wisps float around her, but are rarely seen. They don't appear on any camera or in any mirror, and they only become faintly visible to the naked eye when she allows them to, or is too focused on something else to continue hiding them. Some people with [[Alignment]] can see them more clearly and in more circumstances though.

#### Clothing

Freya's favorite outfit consists of a cropped tank top with thick black and white stripes, a red leather jacket, black fingerless riding gloves, black leather biker pants, and black and white leather boots with red laces. She will often wear the jacket around her waist or take it off entirely to suit the circumstances. She also wears and ancient fire-damaged brass pendant that displays a cherry blossom, held on a red leather necklace. This pendant is one of a matching pair, the other belonging to Kerosyn.

When not wearing that outfit, she strongly prefers flashy masculine clothing, tends to lean towards dark colors plus black and white, has a penchant for stripes, and prefers tops with either no sleeves or very short ones, going so far as to often tear the sleeves off of hoodies. She is only comfortable with sleeves when they're part of a cool jacket, or it's freezing cold.

She virtually always chooses full length pants and boots, but on the rare occasion she doesn't, she will choose light and airy shorts and open-toed footwear. She will sooner kill everyone in the room than wear a skirt, high heels, or anything with frills.

## Special abilities

She wields [[Attunement]] to its fullest potential, able to do quite literally anything short of a feat of creation on her own, but when she, Kerosyn, and Florian work together, they become seemingly omnipotent, capable of reality-altering feats of unknown magnitude. The three of them also seem to share some type of telepathic link, which allows them to always know each other's location and to share strong feelings, but does not allow them to communicate directly.

Her alignment makes her capable of seeing, hearing, and feeling everything on a global scale, possibly even further. This ability is "always-on" in the sense that she always has some perception of everything, but she must specifically focus on the ability to perceive it as anything other than background noise. She is capable of taking in and fully comprehending everything all at once, but it is a massive drain on her both mentally and physically, so she mainly focuses on specific parts of the world at a time, and keeps an "ear" open for particularly interesting events. She may not be omniscient, but she'd be the prime candidate for it. With that in mind, it must be said that her hearing, vision, and reflexes are almost supernaturally good even without utilizing her alignment.

Her signature use of power is to teleport objects, most often her bikes and guns. A fan of the dramatic, she might even teleport in a gun, fire all the loaded ammunition, then teleport it away and replace it with another one instead of reloading or teleporting more ammo into it. She can teleport living things as well, but prefers not to, claiming that it's quite exhausting. Her power manifests mostly as streaks of lightning or static electricity on and around some part of her body along with whatever she's manipulating. 

As an immortal being, she cannot truly die even if she is "killed". If she was shot through the heart and the head, she would just stand back up in a few seconds. She could be decapitated and simply wake back up in a matter of minutes if someone put her head back in place, though the wound would take longer than that to fully heal. In the event she can't simply wake back up, her corpse will disintegrate completely and she will regenerate in the place she was first buried and wake up there instead, though that may take an awfully long time.

## Personality

Freya is a sly, tomboyish flirt overflowing with confidence and charisma who has absolutely zero shame. She is a master of sweet talking and banter, and steals the spotlight wherever she goes, capable of commanding the attention of every person in a crowded bar just by walking in the door, along with nonchalantly talking her way into, out of, or around just about any situation while humiliating others in the process.

She carries herself with a fierce and suggestive swagger, nearly always striking something between arrogance and seduction in her idle body language. She is very expressive, almost always wearing a big toothy grin, giggles and laughs a lot, and always has fire in her eyes. She's also bursting with snark and attitude, even to those closest to her.

She tends to view other people as mere pieces in a game that she happens to be very good at playing, and has a very weak sense of morality, allowing her to lie, cheat, and manipulate people frequently to fulfill her whims and indulgences without guilt. She is no stranger to using her body to her advantage, and will not hesitate to leave in the night without a word, taking whatever she wants with her.

Lust aside, she also takes great pleasure in humiliating or dominating others, both verbally and physically, even enjoying inflicting pain and cruelty on people she dislikes, and there are few that she hates more than those who act weak and fearful. She enjoys violence to an almost disturbing degree, especially when she believes it's justified. Her cravings for these indulgences are constant, and they become harder for her to resist when she's bored and restless... which happens often. She does not value her own safety at all and is all too happy to run head first into her death if she can have fun with it.

Beneath her rough, vulgar, generally not-very-nice outer appearance though, she still has the capacity for compassion and affection, and yearns for real intimate connections. She has extreme difficulty forming new relationships, and even more difficulty maintaining positive ones, leading her to cherish strongly the few friends she may have at any given time. There is no better way to make a good first impression with Freya than to be bold enough to stand up to her, so her friends tend to be quite similar to herself.

In private and among close friends, she can calm down dramatically and seem like a completely different person. She may actually express compassion and affection openly, and on some occasions, can even be rather delicate and feminine. With the amount of trust it takes for her to let her guard down, chances are that anyone who sees this side of her is already her friend for life.

Deep within her heart, she resents her violent nature, so she immerses herself in hobbies to distract from it. Despite living for so long and being capable of mastering anything she puts her mind to, she has a quite limited set of interests and doesn't often branch out from them. Currently, she's fixated on building and riding motorcycles, gunsmithing and marksmanship, and metalworking, and is among the best in the world at these things thanks to her stellar 3D visualization skills and intuitive understanding of physics and material science.

#### Fighting style

Always a fan of the dramatic, she loves to fight in one of two ways with no middle ground if she can help it. Either an explosive show of force capable of dominating the opponent immediately, or allowing the opponent to believe they're winning - even if that means letting them "kill" her - before simply shrugging it all off and dominating them anyway. The ultimate goal either way is the same: To demoralize and humiliate. She revels in the fear and hysteria of her targets, always taunting and laughing at them, sometimes even going so far as to prolong the fight as long as possible even after she has clearly won for her own indulgence.

## Relationships

Having spent close to their entire lives together, Kerosyn, Freya, and Florian are family in all but blood relation. Freya is the oldest of the three.

Freya sees Kerosyn as a younger sibling and is quite protective of them. The two of them share an inseparable bond that runs so deep, Freya is the only person capable of talking Kerosyn out of anger, and one of the only people who can tell what they're truly feeling behind their happy demeanor just by looking. They don't share many of the same interests, but love talking about them together regardless. They bring each other a lot of comfort just by being near. They have kept their matching pendants since the day they met.

She sees Florian as a brother, but they treat each other more like workplace colleagues most of the time due to their very different personalities and interests. While they may not be nearly as close as she is with Kerosyn, she will still stand up for Florian whenever he needs help. Of course, she also enjoys picking on him frequently, but is mindful enough to never take it too far.

The relationship between these three can sometimes appear more parental than that of siblings due to Kerosyn's childlike nature, though they all vehemently reject the idea of that.

Freya is extremely close friends with [[Minerva]]. They met several years before she met Kerosyn, when Freya was only a teenager. Minerva was isolated in hiding, and Freya was a runaway looking for somewhere to hide. They brought out the best in each other, helped each other overcome their weaknesses, and quickly became best friends. She makes regular visits to this day, often times bringing Kerosyn and Florian with her.

Freya is something of an adoptive mother to [[Garm]], though their relationship often outwardly appears more like that of a master and their loyal dog. They both have fun with that arrangement, but when it's quiet, they do truly act like mother and daughter. Anybody familiar with the two of them can see that bond even through the odd public appearance.

She also has very close friendly relationships with [[Dvalinn]] and [[Kuhai]], who she enjoys playfully picking on, plus [[Haida]] and [[Neven]], who she treats much more respectfully. The five of them are like Freya's second family. [[Seth Alden]] is close to this group as well, and as much as they like him, he maintains a degree of professional separation.

Seeing all of those people happy has become Freya's primary - if not *only* - source of genuine happiness over the centuries, so she goes out of her way to spend time with them, protect them, and help them with whatever she can. She cherishes them all more than anything and is quite protective of them.

Additionally, she has a friendly relationship with [[Nikolai Anatolyevich Litvyak]], the only fighter pilot to outlast her in a dogfight. Once she recovered from being shot down, she fiercely, single-mindedly tracked him down, her intention being merely to learn his name, but the moment he learned who she was, he defected to the Risky Witches, his intention being merely to fly with her again. His granddaughter, [[Raisa Ivanovna Litvyak]], resents them both and vowed to shoot them both down herself should they ever meet in the sky.

### Affiliations

Being one of the three deities of the Children of the Flame, Freya is very strongly affiliated with them. She finds what their followers think about her to be pretty funny, but really hates being treated like a god, so she tries very hard to avoid the organization and its members, even going so far as to tell [[The Sixth Storyteller]] not to share any identifiable information about her with the members so she can avoid being recognized. She does occasionally meet with him personally though, mostly to keep him informed.

## History

Some of Freya's history during [[Era Dira]] is described in [[The Account]].

Freya has had a long career of interfering with military affairs. Here is a list of military units that Freya directly joined.
- [[Deadeye Relics]] - Scout infantry
- [[Iron Wings]] - Cavalry unit
- [[Sandman (unit)]] - Night attack infantry
- [[Werewolf (unit)]] - Night attack infantry
- [[Vampire Squadron]] - Ground strike fighter squadron
- [[Sorcerer Squadron]] - Air superiority fighter squadron
- [[Witch Squadron]] - Multirole fighter squadron
- Unnamed Destrean rebel group - Guerrillas, precursor to the Risky Witches

> [!example]- About these units
> Until these links point to pages that exist and have content in them, the names should be considered placeholder for everything except the Witch Squadron. I just came up with them all off the cuff one night because I wanted something to list here that reflects the timeline leading up to the Risky Witches.

## Trivia

- Freya, despite her immortality, still needs to eat and drink to survive like a regular person. If she starves to death, she will come back in the same condition for a short time, then die again, over and over until she gets food.
- Not only does she never sleep, she is physically incapable of sleeping. That's why she has the dark rings around her eyes.
- Freya is an [akanbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akanbe) enthusiast.
- Freya has an itchy trigger finger. Literally, she's always tapping it on things and fidgeting.
- Freya has killed multiple people who found out about her secret little collection of cute plushies.
- Freya has died so many times that she no longer has any inherent reaction to it, only an act for dramatic effect. Allegedly, she lost count at 6400 deaths... a thousand years ago.
- Being so close to Kerosyn, Freya is a very good cook and has a very well developed palate.
- Also thanks to Kerosyn, Freya is a skilled musician. She may lack all of Kerosyn's natural talent, but 3000 years was more than long enough to learn. Her favorite instrument is the guitar - both classical acoustic and modern electric - and while she doesn't like people knowing this, she's an extremely skilled vocalist.

She owns several motorcycles and is always rotating new additions into her collection, never satisfied with her finished projects. Despite that, she has a few forever unfinished favorites that she keeps around and continuously improves.

She loves to collect her favorite guns with a particular appreciation for the classics. Though she always keeps at least one of each model in original condition, she modifies her guns extensively, converting ammunition types (including retrofitting the classic models to fire modern ammunition), modifying barrel/slide length, increasing ammunition capacity, altering firing mechanisms, and so on. Her appreciation runs deep enough that she could tell you the minute differences between multiple seemingly identical guns in her collection, which is as follows:
