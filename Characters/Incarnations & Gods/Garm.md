Garm is a [[Wolf|Wolf spirit]] and one of the five mortal [[Incarnations]]. She is loyal to [[Freya]] and the [[Risky Witches]], and participated in [[The Big Event]].

## Summary

As a mortal incarnation, Garm has been several people throughout history. Every incarnation of Garm shares a number of constant traits, including wild black hair, deep silver eyes, absolute ambidexterity, and an unusual, rather unsettling gait. They possess [[Attunement]] that manifests as monstrous physical strength and durability, and an invisible force that increases their offensive range and perception, but these abilities are both utilized subconsciously. Garm is a frighteningly powerful and vicious fighter thanks not only to brute strength, but also their lightning fast instincts and reflexes. They do not possess [[Alignment]].

Garm has an undying loyalty to their master, provided that master has the tenacity to maintain authority. Until they find a master, they wander like a wild dog, flattening anything in their path. Because their master can have varying goals and ideals through the generations, so too does Garm themselves. Should their master show weakness one too many times, Garm will kill them and begin the search again.

Aside from this summary, the rest of this page applies only to the current incarnation of Garm.

> [!bug] Issue
> The whole physical description heading is old info that I won't be bothering to update until I get a visual representation of her, which may look quite different. At that point, this section of the page will be updated with proper formatting based on that.

## Special abilities

Garm's attunement primarily manifests itself as an invisible force that increases her offensive range and perception subconsciously. This gives her an innate sense of presence, allowing her to vaguely know when a person is nearby, or have a feeling of impending doom when danger is approaching. In combat, this sense allows her to much more accurately predict incoming attacks and react faster, and her range will increase up to double her natural arm's reach. This force can hit with blunt force, a sharp edge, or a fine point depending on what she has in her hands. Some people with alignment may be able to somehow see this force, but to everyone else, it is entirely invisible.

As an incarnation, her attunement also gives her immense, supernatural strength and physical durability, allowing her to lift more than three times her body weight, punch and kick with the force of a small car, and not just survive falls from 20 stories, but walk away from them.

## Personality

With her fierce devotion to Freya and thanks to spending so much time with her, Garm mostly imitates Freya. She is nowhere near as good at smooth talking or flirting as Freya is, but she did inherit the boundless confidence and shamelessness, so she always tries her best.

Garm had virtually no childhood, and the full extent of her education came from soldiers in the Risky Witches, so there is a lot she doesn't know or understand. That combined with Freya's influence, traumatic experiences earlier in her life, and her nature as an incarnation, has left her as an eternal teenager. Childish, arrogant, ignorant, naive, short-tempered, and combative.

She has developed a degree of empathy and compassion since being taken in, but it's reserved exclusively for people she knows and likes or has been taught to protect. With anybody else, she displays no empathy or compassion at all, or even any respect for their lives. This leads to her treating the enemy in combat as little more than toys for her to enjoy tearing apart like a mad dog.

### Motivation

Unlike the rest of the incarnations, Garm has no particular motivation of her own. Instead, her motivation is simply to loyally serve a strong master, which is currently Freya.

## Relationships

Garm was effectively raised by Freya and sees her both as her master and as a mother, though their relationship often outwardly appears more like that of a pet owner and their loyal dog. They both have fun with that arrangement, but when it's quiet, they do truly act like mother and daughter. Anybody familiar with the two of them can see that bond even through the odd public appearance.

Since she was taken in by Freya in the early days of the Risky Witches, she is quite close with many of the oldest members of the organization as well - who are very proud of her - and is quite protective of them. She is also very close with [[Dvalinn]], [[Kuhai]], [[Haida]], and [[Neven]] thanks to Freya bringing them all together.

She treats Dvalinn like a little brother (despite being younger than him) and picks on him a lot, much to his dismay. She sees Kuhai as a rival and enjoys fighting with her. She looks up to Neven like an older sister, and to Haida like a grandmother.

### Affiliations

She is a member of the Risky Witches [[Risky Witches#Special forces|Task Force 5555]] with the effective rank of O-6.

## History

sorry nothing

## Trivia

- She got the nickname "Biscuit" from soldiers before the Risky Witches formed for acting so much like a dog loyal to Freya, even being eager to receive treats for good behavior.
- She has broken almost every bone in her body at least twice each, and has broken her arms so many times in so many places that those bones have become freakishly hard, even by her standards.
- She is an exceptional drummer, but has a tendency to break cymbals.
