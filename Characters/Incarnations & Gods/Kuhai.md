Kuhai is a [[Shark|Shark spirit]] and one of the five mortal [[Incarnations]]. She is loyal to [[Freya]] and the [[Risky Witches]], and participated in [[The Big Event]].

## Summary

As a mortal incarnation, Kuhai has been several people throughout history. Every incarnation of Kuhai shares a number of constant traits, including their towering stature, piercing blue eyes, and ever since [[Shark#Myths and legends|the sacrifice]], a scar in the middle of their forehead resembling a bullet wound. They possess [[Attunement]] that manifests as monstrous physical strength and durability, and an invisible force that increases their offensive range and perception, both of which they wield consciously with calculated consideration. Typically, Kuhai is an independent person with natural leadership skills, but occasionally chooses to follow another to some extent if their goals align. They do not possess [[Alignment]].

Aside from this summary, the rest of this page applies only to the current incarnation of Kuhai.

## Physical description

##### General Physical Condition

- MASSIVE.
- MUSCLES.
- Still got that hourglass shape though. 
    
##### Body Features

- Golden umber skin
- Thresher shark tail.
- Fins around ears.

##### Facial Features

- Black hair with dark blue streaks, medium length wavy bob
- Two rows of sharp, pointed teeth.
- Round, vaguely sad, piercing blue eyes.

##### Identifying Characteristics

Has extensive Maori style tattoos. Full sleeves on both arms, plus shoulders and shoulder blades, upper chest, neck, and her chin are all covered.

- Long light blue linen scarf
- Black hand wraps
- Light blue bootcut yoga pants with white stripe
- White running shoes

##### Specialized Equipment

Wields a glaive with a heavy, wide blade, and a telescopic handle. Fully extended, the handle reaches 9 feet (2.75 meters), and it collapses to half that. Her ability to extend her attack reach through attunement affects this weapon too, giving her a ridiculous maximum effective reach of 24 feet (7.3 meters).

> [!bug] Issue
> The whole physical description heading is old info that I won't be bothering to update until I get a visual representation of her, which may look quite different. At that point, this section of the page will be updated with proper formatting based on that.

## Special abilities

Kuhai's attunement primarily manifests itself as an invisible force that increases her offensive range and perception, and a strong intuition that allows her to sense danger, intent, and hidden people. Her range can increase up to double the length of her arm or her weapon, whichever is longer, and the individual force can hit with a fine point, a sharp edge, or blunt force. She has full control over this ability, and can even utilize it to assist her with wielding unreasonably large or heavy weapons. Some people with alignment may be able to somehow see this force, but to everyone else, it is entirely invisible.

As an incarnation, her attunement also gives her immense, supernatural strength and physical durability, allowing her to lift more than six times her body weight, punch and kick with the force of a truck, remain standing when hit with force up to that of a small car at 12 miles per hour, jump twice as high as her own height, sustain severe blood loss without losing strength, and not just survive falls from 30 stories, but hit the ground running with no injuries.

Out of all the incarnations, including the immortal three, Kuhai is the strongest, most imposing, and most fearsome. Even Freya fears her strength, despite the fact she doesn't fear Kuhai as a person. This combined with her strong leadership and small army of loyal followers also makes her appear more like a god than any of the other incarnations, aside from [[Kerosyn]]. Her personality does not live up to her appearance, however.

## Personality

Kuhai exudes a fierce and intimidating aura thanks to her imposing stature, piercing eyes, and permanent scowl, made even worse by her booming voice and tendency to speak bluntly. She takes full advantage of this as necessary to utilize her incredible leadership skills wherever they are needed, able to effectively command a small army single handedly, both in and out of combat.

Beneath this appearance, however, is a surprisingly tender and compassionate soul. Above all, she cares about the safety of her people and takes every measure possible to ensure that she always hears their feelings and concerns, and is always kept aware of their conditions, always ready and willing to change or even abandon her plans or strategies if it means the safety of her people. Despite her godlike combat prowess and world-class military strategy and leadership ability, her ultimate desire is peace and security, and she will only fight when she believes that a victory is ensured and will bring her closer to that goal without unnecessary sacrifice.

In smaller scale, more social environments, her adamant nature dissolves. Being in a leadership position and even venerated for most of her life, she has had close to zero meaningful social experience, leaving her anxious, easily flustered, and extremely awkward at times. Her social difficulties are made worse by her difficulties with learning anything that isn't either a physical activity or physically demonstrable. Because of that, she tends to avoid social activities and environments for her own comfort, but with people she knows and trusts, she tries her best to push through her anxiety and awkwardness, knowing it will make them happy... even though she has trouble understanding a lot of things. She can talk about combat, leadership, strategy, and fitness for hours without missing a beat, but not much else.

### Motivation

Kuhai is primarily concerned with the safety of her people in her homeland of [[Isla Sofia]], and secondarily concerned with the safety of Isla Sofia itself and all the people in it, and will go to extreme lengths to ensure no harm comes to them.

Of course, that made her very easy for Freya to recruit to the Risky Witches by promising the safety of the island. Over time, Kuhai became invested in the greater cause of the Risky Witches and devoted herself to it entirely on the condition that Isla Sofia take priority should it ever be threatened.

## Relationships

Kuhai's blunt and serious outward nature combined with her awkward and naive inner nature on top of her revered status in her homeland have historically made it difficult for her to form close relationships, but Freya changed that. She developed a huge crush on Freya at first sight and immediately accepted the invitation to the Risky Witches, which ended up being full of people much easier for her to talk to.

She treats [[Dvalinn]], [[Haida]], and [[Neven]] with great respect and considers them great friends worth protecting. [[Garm]], meanwhile, she sees more like an annoying younger relative, and is a little jealous of her closeness with Freya. Still someone worth protecting, but with less respect, leading to a lot of childish bickering and challenges. Despite that (or perhaps because of that) she is closest with Garm out of everyone in the unit, and they can often be found sparring together.

### Affiliations

She is a member of the Risky Witches [[Risky Witches#Special forces|Task Force 5555]] with the effective rank of O-6.

## History

sorry nothing

## Trivia

- Most people believe her "Charmer" nickname came from her short temper and blunt words, but she actually got this nickname from trying to backtalk Freya. She failed miserably, got flustered, turned beet red, and stuttered up a storm, so she gave up and scurried away. And nobody close to her plans on letting her forget that any time soon.
- She speaks only two languages fluently. Everyone she knows in the Risky Witches speaks at least four languages fluently. She wants to learn more to keep up with everyone else, but has extreme difficulty with that and is ashamed of it.
