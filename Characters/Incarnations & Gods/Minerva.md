*This is what little info existed before this page did.*

Goddess of knowledge and wisdom. She is extremely reclusive to the point that not only does nobody know she exists, there isn't even any evidence of the massive library ([[The Absolute Library]]) she lives in physically existing. Housed inside a massive hollowed out mountain, she is in constant concentration manipulating the mystic matter around the mountain to hide any evidence of the mountain being out of the ordinary, and to repel people from coming close, save for the few mouse spirits that are seeking out the library to help her maintain it and her close friends, [[Kerosyn]], [[Freya]] and [[Florian]]. 

She was born with an innate knowledge of everything that exists and all history, but does not possess foresight and cannot write prophecies, though she can make some very well educated guesses and be right most of the time. She is clumsy, extremely quiet - speaking almost in a whisper - and always tries her best to appear dignified and wise, but is very shy and will run away if she messes up a word or doesn't know how to respond to a question. However, when she's with people she's comfortable with and is coaxed out of her shell, she has a very goofy personality and acts a bit childish. 

She is very small and kind of frail, and usually looks kind of unkempt, only made worse by her tendency to wear clothes several sizes too big.

> [!example]- A note about this character
> Minerva is a holdover from an earlier attempt at worldbuilding that was thrown away in the process of creating my album, Towers. Her entire origin story is effectively gone, and that’s fine, I like the idea of a goddess existing without explanation, but because of that and the fact that I’ve been focusing on pretty much anything else, she remains unused and undeveloped. All I know for certain is I want to involve her in something in the future.
