[[Yoshida]]

[[Ryoko Kijima]]

*Rotary Lord* | LAW #5

Energetic, sly, and determined, dedicated entirely to rotary power. Always smiling, he can be hard to read. His burning passion for the rotary engine led to his builds being the fastest rotaries on the road, hence his nickname, but none of his customer cars ever reached the level of his own. His reputation is tied deeply with that of the rotary engine in general, and he knows it. He only races to keep the passion of the rotary alive, not for personal gain. And for fun.
