*Upstart Trickster* | EXCEED #1

Plucky tomboy with a strong sense of justice. Not actually Masashi's daughter, she's his niece by blood, but was adopted by him. They shared a last name even before this as her mother never married. Haruna was enchanted at a young age by the allure of gas powered cars and high speed highway racing after hearing a story from Masashi, and ultimately it was him that directly introduced her to the scene when he revealed his past as a mechanic and racer, and he taught her everything she knows. When he set her up to race, she at first simply wanted to enjoy the ride and have fun, but as she raced more and met more people, she began learning more and more about Masashi, the past, and the corruption controlling the scene today. Her passion only burned brighter as she learned more and worked to uncover the mystery.
