[[Yoshida]]

*Akuma* | LAW #2

Even colder and ruthless, forever rivals with Yoshida, and one of the only people capable of challenging him. He too is devoted entirely to being the best racer on the highway, but doesn't care about honor or morality. Some members of Run Free believe that Hosoki would continue a race and claim the victory without a second thought even if he witnessed his opponent crash into oncoming traffic. Dangerous driver, all bark and no bite in person.
