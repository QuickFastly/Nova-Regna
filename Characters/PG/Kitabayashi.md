*Blaze* | LAW #3

Humble and uncompetitive, close friends with Mizota. If you asked him, he'd tell you that he's not actually all that interested in racing, it's just a fun side hobby. His real passion is dedicated entirely to building some of the smoothest, most refined high power cars on the road, rivalling even PSW. While that isn't a lie, racing is far more important to him than he lets on, especially after meeting Mizota, a like-minded builder he learns a lot from.
