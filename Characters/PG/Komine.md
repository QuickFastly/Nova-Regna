[[Yoshida]]

*Merlin* | EXCEED #4

Mysterious, sentimental, and always calm. Once the very best air-cooled tuner, he still has a reputation today for his incredible skill, partly because Yoshida is still running an engine tuned by him. He has a deep personal connection to his work and can get quite emotional at times, though you'd have to be close with him to notice. Having lost his customers, he began working with Nakai to create the ultimate air-cooled pair, and joined Haruna to confront Yoshida.
