[[Phantom Special Works]]

[[Haruna Kitami]]

*Phantom Sorcerer*

Cool uncle, protective but trusting, legendary mechanic and formidable unaffiliated racer. He disappeared from the scene with no warning after adopting Haruna, wanting to care for her as best he could without being tied to such a high risk business. Now he uses his skills to provide Haruna with the speed she craves, eventually returning to the scene as Haruna wins races and word spreads that Phantom Special Works has returned.
