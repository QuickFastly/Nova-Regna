*Silver Wind* | LAW #4

Dignified and friendly, close friends with Kitabayashi. Racing was never his first choice, as he originally only wanted to promote his tuning shop, but his builds just happened to dominate the road and he was picked up by Run Free as a result. Even now, his focus is primarily on tuning rather than racing, but no matter how tries to deny it or dodge the question, it's easy to see that he's become quite competitive, especially with Kitabayashi as rival tuners.
