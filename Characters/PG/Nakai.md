[[EXCEED]]

*Nighthawk* | EXCEED #5

Rather intimidating on first impression and hard to approach, breaking through that rough exterior reveals a deeply passionate individual. He's better described not as a racer, not as a tuner, but as an artist devoted entirely to his craft. That craft just happens to be building beautifully wild cars that happen to be fast as well. With the corruption taking away his customers and passion, his latest car is built and driven in anger together with Komine.
