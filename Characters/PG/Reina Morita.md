[[EXCEED]]

*Asura* | EXCEED #3

Hotheaded and boisterous, childhood friends and rivals with Ryoko. She is very competitive and always strives to beat Ryoko in whatever they do, but she very rarely does as they both develop and improve at the same rate but Ryoko always seems to have a slight advantage. Interestingly, even though her nickname fits perfectly, it actually has nothing to do with her. It comes from her car, as it was previously owned by an infamous racer that disappeared.
