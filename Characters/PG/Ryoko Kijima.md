[[EXCEED]]

*Silent Violet* | EXCEED #2

Level headed and calm, vice president of Exceed. It was Ryoko that actually proposed the idea of forming Exceed first, but the leader was chosen between herself, Reina and Haruna with a race. She built a reputation for never messaging her opponents, just racing and then disappearing right away. Aside from Reina, Haruna is the first racer she's made contact with. Her true nature is quite different from what her reputation leads on, as she's quite talkative.
