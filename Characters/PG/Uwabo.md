[[LAW]]

[[Yoshida]]

*Golden Shadow* | LAW #6

Wise and cryptic, vice president of the Run Free Race Team. Older than he looks but younger than he acts, nobody really knows what's going on in his head or why he does what he does except for Yoshida. More rumors surround Uwabo than any other Run Free member, some believing that he's actually the owner of a tuning shop of mythical proportions, and has connections to every dealer in the country. He definitely knows much more than he lets on.
