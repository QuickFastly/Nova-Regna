[[LAW]]

*Raven* | LAW #1

Cold and honorable, founder and president of the Run Free Race Team. In Run Free, he is the only member who didn't build and tune his own car, instead trusting Komine with the task, bringing him up as a legend too. His car is among the fastest and most expensive ever run on the highway, but he remains somewhat humble about that. He is devoted entirely to being the best racer on the highway, but adheres to a strong moral compass.
