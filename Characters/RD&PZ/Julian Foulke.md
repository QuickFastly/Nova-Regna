Julian Foulke is the main antagonist of the Alden Archives. Foulke was formerly the Senior Energy Production Officer for [[Concordia]] before being discovered as a plant for [[11K]]. Using Concordia's research he managed to create a system that visualized mystic matter to the unattuned, which would enable 11K to make significant strides in their own research and development.  

Early on in the plot its revealed that Foulke has seemingly vanished from Concordia and his home left in tatters  to suggest kidnapping. This was a ploy for 11K to extract Foulke without suspicion. His disappearance indirectly results in [[Seth Alden]] discovering the VEX system along with an imprisoned [[Azenor Connaway]].  

Foulke is later revealed to have taken the designs for an experimental [[Mystic Matter|mystic matter]] reactor he was developing for Concordia and sold them to 11K. On the launch date of the first reactor Foulke infiltrates the ceremony and is discovered by Seth. A chase ensues ending in the Junction, where he reveals the truth to Seth. He is then seen jumping down onto a rail line onto a conspicuous train heading outbound from the facility. Realizing there's time to stop the inevitable destruction of the reactor and the Core, Seth races to the control room. There Seth is recorded trying to fight his way to the controls. After finally reaching the terminal its revealed that the sequence can not be stopped without an override. Seth attempts to get Azenor to override it with the VEX system. She manages to do so before revealing that she is also a product of 11K, and is forced into restarting the sequence.
