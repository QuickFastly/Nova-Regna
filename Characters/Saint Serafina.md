A nun from [[Savorra]] whose actions and demeanor through the horrors she experienced led to her being venerated as a saint by the church of [[Rethianity]], a kami by [[The Open Hand]] with a shrine dedicated to her, and a legend by the [[Children of the Flame]]. [[Mae Seraphine Walker]] is her direct, though distant, descendant.
