Add a brief explanation of who the character is and where they appear. One or two sentences is most likely all you need here, unless they were involved in an important event and you want it immediately noted.

## Summary

Add a more detailed summary of the character here.

## Physical description

Describe the appearance and build of the character, as detailed as you can. If you want to get *super* detailed about certain aspects, feel free to add subheadings for things like outfits or conditions.

## Special abilities

If this character has [[Alignment]] or [[Attunement]], since those conditions manifest differently for everyone, describe that here. Anything other than those conditions should be *exceptionally* special to be included here. Not all characters are special, so remove this section if you have nothing for it.

## Personality

Describe their personality here, using subheadings if you need to.

## Relationships

Describe the character's relationships with other characters here.

### Affiliations

If the character is affiliated with any organizations or groups and it's important, describe them here.

## History

Describe the character's personal history here. If you want a brief visual representation of the character's history, you can insert the small timeline template at the top of the page, between the start of the main text and the end of the infobox html.

If you want to go into extreme detail about this, consider using this section to write a synopsis and create additional, separate pages for events the character was involved with as needed.

## Trivia

Anything else you want to include about the character that doesn't really fit in any of the above headings can go here.
