Hi, I'm Kit, and this is the Nova Regna wiki. Nova Regna is the working name for the world that practically all of my stories and characters exist in, because calling it the Keroverse instead would be boring, but officially the world has no title.

This is a worldbuilding project that I've been slowly building on for quite a long time, mostly alone with some great contributions from a couple of friends. I thought it was time to change that, and that's why this wiki exists.

**This is an [open world](https://opendefinition.org/)**, and everything within it - unless explicitly stated otherwise - is licensed under [Creative Commons CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). Anybody can [[CONTRIBUTING|contribute]] anything to this world, and [[Usage Guidelines|use]] anything in it however they want.
