Hi, I'm Kit, and this is the Nova Regna wiki. Nova Regna is the working name for the world that practically all of my stories and characters exist in, because calling it the Keroverse instead would be boring, but officially the world has no title.

This is a worldbuilding project that I've been slowly building on for quite a long time, mostly alone with some great contributions from a couple of friends. I thought it was time to change that, and that's why this wiki exists.

**This is an [open world](https://opendefinition.org/)**, and everything within it - *unless explicitly stated otherwise* - is licensed under [Creative Commons CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). Anybody can [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) anything to this world, and [use](Usage%20Guidelines.md) anything in it however they want.

%% If you're viewing the GitHub repo and you can read this line, you should know that I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), so everything here is made with that in mind. On GitHub, a lot of the formatting does not render correctly, like these commented lines. Wikilinks also don't work, making navigation very cumbersome.

A quick way to set up and view this wiki in your own Obsidian installation is to click the Code button at the top right of the repo, click Download ZIP, extract that somewhere, and then open that folder as a vault within Obsidian. I also recommend using these plugins:
[Image Toolkit](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-image-toolkit ) / https://github.com/sissilab/obsidian-image-toolkit
[Metatable](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-metatable) / https://github.com/arnau/obsidian-metatable

Check the contributing page for a more complicated method that, wouldn't you know it, also makes it easy to contribute. %%
