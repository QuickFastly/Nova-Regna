There zero restrictions on how you use anything in this world, you have total creative freedom with your own creations provided you abide by the appropriate license(s). Unless an article you look at explicitly says otherwise, everything here is licensed under [Creative Commons CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). Because of that, while you will be restricted to using the same or a compatible license on your work, it isn't even *possible* to control how you use this content.

However, there is still something you must keep in mind.

If what you intend to create will *directly reference*, or be used to *actively promote* **real-world** politics, ideologies, religious beliefs, or violence, [do not provide attribution](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-can-i-do-if-i-offer-my-material-under-a-creative-commons-license-and-i-do-not-like-the-way-someone-uses-it). This is universal and non-negotiable.

The same applies if your work can be considered [hate speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech), but due to the fact that this is fiction, that isn't as simple to define. If you include such content for any purpose other than a legitimate and thought-out in-world one, do not provide attribution.

The contributors to this world also all reserve the right to have you remove attribution to them and their content at any time, for any reason, where applicable.

Always check if the articles you reference are under a different license with different requirements and restrictions. Some contributors may even use non-free licenses and provide detailed terms of use for their content.

Finally, when providing attribution, always check the articles you reference to see if there are one or more authors listed. If there is no author listed, then you don't need to list an author in your attribution. Remember to follow the [best practices for attribution](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/best_practices_for_attribution).
