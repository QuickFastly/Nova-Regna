Unexplainable by science but clearly visible as fact, incarnations are particular types of [[Spirits|spirits]] that hold an immeasurable, almost otherworldly amount of power. There is only a single incarnation alive at any given time belonging to each type of major spirit, and none among minor spirits. When one dies, another is born.

Incarnations seem to be divided into two groups, mortal and immortal. The power held by each mortal incarnation seems to vary wildly, while the immortal incarnations appear to hold nearly infinite power.

A wealth of myths and legends exist claiming to explain the existence of these incarnations, but none have ever been confirmed. Even the [[Children of the Flame]] have their own explanation that they claim has been passed down by their gods as divine truth, but while it is known that they have this information, the information itself is a closely guarded secret.

All that is fully known about the incarnations is that their power is tied directly to [[Mystic Matter|mystic matter]] and appears to defy all logical boundaries, and their lifespans are far longer than average spirits of their respective varieties.

Mortal incarnations all adopt the same name with each generation, even without outside influence, and bear an uncannily striking resemblance to their ancestors. They even appear to retain some memories of their ancestors, though they are rather vague and limited to major events in their lives.

There are five mortal incarnations:
- [[Dvalinn]] [[Deer|(deer)]]
- [[Garm]] [[Wolf|(wolf)]]
- [[Haida]] [[Mouse|(mouse)]]
- [[Kuhai]] [[Shark|(shark)]]
- [[Neven]] [[Chameleon|(chameleon)]]

There are three immortal incarnations:
- [[Florian]] [[Crow|(crow)]]
- [[Freya]] [[Cat|(cat)]]
- [[Kerosyn]] [[Fox|(fox)]]
