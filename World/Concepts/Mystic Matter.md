Mystic matter is a type of naturally occurring substance found in nearly everything that exists on [[Earth]]. It is required for life to be born, but not always required to sustain it, though it does play a vital role in regulating the health of many living things.

This is the substance that is perceived by people with [[Alignment]] and manipulated by people with [[Attunement]].[^1]

Being a very recent discovery that defies virtually all prior scientific understanding and is capable of turning the laws of physics upside down, very little is known or understood about mystic matter today.

It has proven an incredibly difficult subject of study, as most research conducted to this day has turned out inconclusive, inconsequential, or invalid. The study of mystic matter also struggles with very limited funding and attention, as many scientific organizations have yet to acknowledge its existence as true.

## Manifestation

Mystic matter is comprised of equal parts of subatomic particles and their antiparticles. It is formless, and in all cases observed as of yet, flows through all other matter, in any phase, unimpeded. Rarely it may "pick up" atoms from surrounding matter, which may then be dissolved into particles, carried along harmlessly and intact, or in extremely rare cases - typically in areas where mystic matter is less dense - be mirrored by antiparticles, the most common resulting antimatter from that process likely being antihydrogen atoms.

The easiest way to recognize the effects of Mystic matter without alignment is to look at the landscape of [[Alastor]]. Each of the three islands has a vastly different concentration of mystic matter flowing through it. The central island of [[Alexandria]] has normal levels of mystic matter and looks perfectly natural. The western island, [[Electra]], has extremely low levels of mystic matter causing the landscape to look ravaged, mutated, even eldritch, and crops to be almost entirely unviable, while also reportedly having significant negative effects on the mental health of people who stay there for prolonged periods. The eastern island, [[Panacea]], has extremely high levels of mystic matter causing the landscape to look unnaturally beautiful and crop output to more than triple, and the people who stay there to experience positive effects on their mental health. The animals of these islands can be found subject to the same effects, albeit less severely.

There are two leading hypotheses to explain how this matter can exist. One is that dark matter is also part of the composition of mystic matter, and the other is that mystic matter is a universally constant quantum wave function. Both of these concepts are exceedingly difficult to study, however, so they are not well supported or widely pursued.

It is also theorized that the effects of the presence of mystic matter on living things vary based on the mental capacity and state of the subjects, and while the theory has been proven in a preliminary study, further study is required.[^2]

## History

Most matter exists in one of four phases, namely solid, liquid, gas, or plasma. However, a fifth phase was discovered on accident during a study on the effects of introducing different forms of energy to plant matter. What was once thought to simply be a byproduct of some type of matter or "subatomic dust" as some had called it, when examined closer, was found to have a pattern.

All attempts to study mystic matter produced nothing meaningful, as researchers could not cause any interaction between the particles and antiparticles leading all tests to produce known normal results. Many researchers dismissed the matter after these results, but a certain few grew obsessive in their search for answers. Eventually, they grew so desperate that they began reaching out to the religious organizations of the world hoping one of them could give them a different perspective from which to approach the problem. They got more than what they bargained for from the [[Children of the Flame]], as they were also researching this phase of matter on their own behind closed doors.

When speaking with an aligned person about this phase of matter, it was learned that what people with alignment are perceiving is actually the matter itself. Through them, it was learned that all the "magic" people with attunement could perform is actually accomplished by directly yet unconsciously manipulating this matter. Even with this amazing discovery, the researchers could not find any logical explanations for the role or capabilities of this matter in existence, nor could they learn anything about how alignment and attunement are gained or how they function. It broke countless known laws of physics and didn't seem to follow any semblance of logic, and so it was named the mystic phase of matter to reflect its nature as a seemingly supernatural substance.
