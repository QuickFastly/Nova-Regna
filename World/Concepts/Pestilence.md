Mortality, expiration, oblivion, departure, passing, or what is most simply known as death, Pestilence is that which brings it about.

For the most part, only the highest ranking members of the [[Children of the Flame]] know the truth of Pestilence. They guard this knowledge with their very lives, and have gone so far as to silence those who threaten to leak it to the public. That's not stopping anyone from carrying out their own research in secret though, especially if they know how to avoid the organization's prying eyes.

Areas with a very *low* density of [[Mystic Matter|mystic matter]] are *more* susceptible to the effects of pestilence, and areas with a very *high* density of mystic matter are *less* susceptible to the effects of pestilence.

[[Florian]] has dedicated himself almost entirely to the study of pestilence, and is the foremost authority on its nature. His goal is to eradicate it and defeat death once and for all.

## Deathlessness

The condition known as "Death" is not natural. It is an arcane curse placed upon all life at the turn of the new era, and it is possible to remove this curse at great cost.

Those who have overcome Pestilence fall under this condition. All you need to know is in the name, really. Gain this condition, and you are no longer subject to death by aging. You will also gain immunity to many diseases that are normally terminal, most notably cancer, but some pathogens will still carry their normal risks. Physical injury will also continue to affect you as anyone else.

Because of how remarkably few people have ever achieved this condition throughout the history of the world and how heavily they guard their secrets, nobody but the Deathless ones know precisely how this condition is achieved. Each person who has achieved it used a different method as well, throwing even more confusion into the mix. All that is known for certain is that the cost is immense, and could even be tantamount to atrocity, though nothing is shared about what the cost truly *is*.
