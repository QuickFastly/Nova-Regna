## Grenn 

*(Born in 1381 ED. Killed by Kerosyn in 11 ED. Died 1370 years old.)*

Seventh born of the original creators, he was known as the God of Greed and Gluttony. He was very mean spirited and entitled, believing he rightfully deserved far more than what he got and would often manipulate others to further his own desires, but was nowhere near as smart as Lilith and didn't always succeed as a result. After being imprisoned for a long time, he became far more willing to commit evil acts. 

The most damning of all things ever to be left on humanity was entirely his doing, and that is Pestilence. Were it not for Grenn's childishly greedy desires, humanity would not be subject to death by aging, several types of disease would never have existed, and the planet itself would not have so much arid and lifeless land. And yet, despite all his efforts to gain power and notoriety, he has been completely forgotten. The fact that Grenneria bears his name and was originally founded on many of his principles is an ironic coincidence. In the story of the inferno held by the Children of the Flame, "the false one" refers to Grenn in "name" only.

He was partially responsible for the creation of chameleon spirits, but they soon rejected him and his ways, choosing to model themselves after Syn instead.

His soul was inherited by [[Florian]].
