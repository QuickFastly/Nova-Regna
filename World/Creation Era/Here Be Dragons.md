I don't know why you're here, but you probably shouldn't be here.

I even made sure to keep links to and from this part of the wiki to the absolute minimum.

The information in this part of the wiki, namely that of the true Era Dira - the creation era - is lost to time. Nobody in the world knows this stuff except for the remaining gods, the Children of the Flame, and the extremely few individuals they have told. In over 99% of cases, you do not need to know this information, because you will never encounter a situation where you need to know it, and you will never use it yourself.

If for some reason you are absolutely sure you have a use for this information, please think *extremely carefully* about how to approach this, because you must remember, anything you create using this information will *at best* be fading fast after the first century, and completely alien to basically everyone on the planet after the year 400 or so.

Here's the **full** list of people aware of *anything* here:
- Kerosyn, Freya, Florian, Ain, and Minerva. They were there.
- A small number of the spirits that work for Minerva have partial knowledge.
- The Sixth Storyteller heard a lot from Kerosyn, Freya, and Florian.
- Mae Walker and Leon Wolfe heard vague bits and pieces from the Storyteller.
- Maybe an insanely small number of crow and fox spirits out there have some of their stories straight, but they might not even be aware of that since it became folklore.
- Darian Williams knows just enough to be dangerous, but nothing specific, and doesn't share what he knows with anyone. He heard something from Florian once, and that's why he's deathless.
- Near Amago knows something isn't right, but doesn't actually know anything. Since Kerosyn approached him, he's been putting pieces together blindly.
- Seth Alden might have put a couple pieces together blindly himself from his time with Freya and the Risky Witches, but wouldn't even know as much (little) as Near does.

In conclusion, go away. This stuff is useless to you and you shouldn't even know it exists. This is cursed knowledge. Applying any of this to what you create, unless it's in line with the incredibly specific limitations above, is like metagaming in D&D, and nobody likes a metagamer.

Basically, this entire era is what I used to make [Towers](https://kerosyn.bandcamp.com/album/towers), and it serves no other purpose. It all burned down not only for the story, but because I didn't want to keep using it.

On top of all that, the information in this part of the wiki may be outdated, incomplete, vague, or poorly worded, and it's not going to get updated because there's no point in doing that.

But if you're just curious, be my guest I guess. Or if you want to create things that take place in Era Dira I suppose. That's cool too, but remember to be aware that the world will not remember it.

The [[True Era Dira timeline]] is quite different to what the world is aware of now.

Kerosyn, Freya, and Florian are actually fourth generation gods, unrelated to the divine blood, and played no part in the creation of the world. The first gods are [[Forsete]] and [[Sofia]], and their children are (in order) [[Uriel]], [[Irene]], [[Rozan]], [[Syn]], [[Lilith]], [[Keres]], [[Grenn]], and [[Samil]]. The final gods born to those children are (in order) [[Ain]], [[Minerva]], and [[Morrigan]]. The incarnations came to be after the original gods all died.
