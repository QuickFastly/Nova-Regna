## Forsete 

*(Killed by Uriel in 1100 ED. Age unknown.)*

Part of the original pair of creator gods (the other being [[Sofia]]), also known as the God of Justice. He was quite uptight and extremely strict about upholding his standard of order, even though he was not very good at being fair and had some questionable ideals. 

He was never well liked by anyone and has been well and truly forgotten by history. 

His children are [[Uriel]], [[Irene]], [[Rozan]], [[Syn]], [[Lilith]], [[Keres]], [[Grenn]], and [[Samil]].

His soul faded away into nothing, inherited by nobody, forgotten before the era ended.
