## Lilith 

*(Born in 1776 ED. Killed by Grenn in 1021 ED. Died 755 years old.)*

Fifth born of the original creators, she was known as the Goddess of Lust and Deception. She lived for sex and pleasure and would always find a way to get what she wanted. She was not well liked as a result, but she didn't care, all she wanted was power which led her to fall in love with Samil rather than fear him. 

She left a large mark on humanity, as she was solely responsible for the introduction of lust and deception in the first place, and even her name still remains in memory as a symbol of lust and deception. However, who she really was has been completely forgotten, and more commonly her name is used in strange sexual folklore and scary stories, attributed to a wide array of creatures. 

She was partially responsible for the creation of the fox spirits, and solely responsible for the creation of a huge number of minor spirits along with the groundwork for new types of minor spirit to appear naturally. 

Together with [[Samil]], she had a daughter, [[Morrigan]]. This daughter was also the first, and mother to all the crow spirits.

Her soul was inherited by [[Freya]].
