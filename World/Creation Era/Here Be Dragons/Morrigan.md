## Morrigan 

*(Born in 1055 ED. Killed by Grenn in 1013 ED. Died 42 years old)*

The first of the crow spirits, a product of pure corruption, she was born to [[Samil]] and [[Lilith]]. She was known as many things. Goddess of corruption, fear, the night, war, murder, the list goes on, but alongside all of those various titles, she was known as the mother to all crows. 

She was quite vicious by nature considering her parents, often killing humans indiscriminately without provocation, interfering with active wars just to revel in the bloodshed, and would carry these things out slowly, methodically, and gruesomely, all the while taking small breaks to have a child or two. She was a horrible parent though, leaving her kids motherless and often fatherless. Only when she was critically injured in a crossfire did she mellow out at all, at which point she found her firstborn son Florian by chance and decided to stay with him and teach him her ways, but she ended up learning more from him than he did from her in that time and grew repentant for her actions. 

Her most obvious mark on history is that the existence of the crow spirits has persisted. Had she chosen not to have children of her own, this form of spirit would have been exclusive to her and ceased to exist. Her name and an exaggerated caricature of her also remains very firmly in the minds of the people through both history and folklore, remembered as a horrible nightmare and the embodiment of death itself, leading crows (both spirit and animal) to be feared by many, even among some non-superstitious people. However, most crow spirits remember her repentance and consider her a tragic martyr, and a very small number of other people believe that story as well.

Her soul was inherited by [[Florian]].

An old version: *Of the old gods, Morrigan is the only one truly still in living memory. Her name, her life, and her likeness are all known to most living crow spirits, not just to Florian. Among them, her true legacy of repentance is maintained, though the crow spirits lack the numbers and influence to dispel the incorrect beliefs of others regarding Morrigan. To them, they see a role model and even an idol in her last years. Florian too, but not as much. Ironic, considering that he is her direct descendant.*
