The following is the true timeline of Era Dira, vague and brief it may be. Key events are covered and placed here, but there's not really any detail because detail was never necessary.

That said, more detail is still found in the story included with [Towers](https://kerosyn.bandcamp.com/album/towers), AKA [[The Account]]. The album itself begins around 26 ED if you were curious about that.
