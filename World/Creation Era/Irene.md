## Irene 

*(Born in 2105 ED. Committed suicide in 1059 ED. Died 1046 years old.)*

Second born of the original creators, she was known as the Goddess of Peace and Prosperity. She was insufferably innocent and naive. 

Her only remaining mark in history is a vague illustrative reference of her death, of which not even a hint of the circumstances remain. 

She was partially responsible for the creation of the deer spirits. 

Together with [[Uriel]], she had a daughter, [[Ain]], who carries her legacy to this day.

Her soul was inherited by [[Dvalinn]].
