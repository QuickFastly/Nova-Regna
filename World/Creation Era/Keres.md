## Keres 

*(Born in 1657 ED. Killed by Samil in 1059 ED. Died 598 years old.)*

Sixth born of the original creators, she was known as the Goddess of Death and Chaos. She was a kind of crazy and had a short fuse, prone to temperamental meltdowns that would come with widespread wanton death and throw people into chaotic frenzies, but truly didn't want to be that way and tried her best to suppress that and be a good girl. Naturally, she got in many fights with [[Syn]], but they had a close relationship regardless and worked together on almost everything. 

She indirectly left a massive mark on humanity since it was her decision to give humans limited lifespans, but she was not responsible at all for the Pestilence that now controls that. Some vague tales of her temper tantrums remain in folklore, but are incorrectly attributed to Morrigan. She may also be partial inspiration for Kerosyn's name, but it's impossible to know as even he couldn't tell you. 

She was partially responsible for the creation of the shark spirits.

Her soul was inherited by [[Kuhai]].
