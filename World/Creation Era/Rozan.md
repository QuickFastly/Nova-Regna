## Rozan 

*(Born in 2040 ED. Killed by Lilith in 1115 ED. Died 925 years old.)*

Third born of the original creators, she was known as the Goddess of Fate and Knowledge. She was quite mysterious and mystical, introverted, and was never well liked until it was too late because of her continual grim predictions. 

While she has left no marks on general human history, nearly all of her predictions and other writings covering thousands of years into the future are still preserved in secret. The tales of her endless library are still passed down among many mouse spirits, a dedicated few of which actually assist in its maintenance. 

She was partially responsible for the creation of the mouse spirits. 

Together with [[Uriel]], she had a daughter, [[Minerva]], who carries her legacy to this day.

Her soul was inherited by [[Haida]].
