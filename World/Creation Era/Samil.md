## Samil 

*(Born in 1111 ED. Killed by Grenn in 1015 ED. Died 96 years old.)*

Eighth born of the original creators, he was known as the God of Destruction and Sin. His very existence was a mistake, his personality little more than an embodiment of anger and violence. Nothing he did was good and he was feared by all, except for Lilith who fell in love with him, though he cared little. 

He was the catalyst that ultimately brought about the first end of the world. He remains vaguely in history as "the destroyer" in the story of the inferno held by the Children of the Flame. Apart from that reference in "name" only, he has faded entirely from history. 

Together with [[Lilith]], he had a daughter, [[Morrigan]]. This daughter was also the first of the crow spirits.

His soul was inherited by [[Kerosyn]].
