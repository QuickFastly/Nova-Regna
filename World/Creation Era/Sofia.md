## Sofia 

*(Ceased to exist after sacrificing all her power in 10 ED. Age unknown.)*

Part of the original pair of creator gods (the other being [[Forsete]]), also known as the Goddess of Wisdom. She was decidedly neutral in nearly all things, extremely compassionate, and truly loved her creations even going so far as to sacrifice herself for the sake of them. 

Of the original 13 gods, she made by far the largest impact on the minds of humanity who still pass down tales speaking of her deeds, even though her name and face have been forgotten, and these tales are often used as a model of how to act good and morally, even by many non-religious people. 

Her children are [[Uriel]], [[Irene]], [[Rozan]], [[Syn]], [[Lilith]], [[Keres]], [[Grenn]], and [[Samil]]. 

She was solely responsible for the creation of humans, though she had help actually carrying out her plan. She was also partially responsible for the creation of the fox, wolf, deer, mouse, shark, and chameleon spirits.

Her soul was split in three parts between [[Florian]], [[Freya]], and [[Kerosyn]].
