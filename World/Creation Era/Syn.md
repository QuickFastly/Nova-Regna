## Syn 

*(Born in 1962 ED. Killed by Keres in 1060 ED. Died 902 years old.)*

Fourth born of the original creators, she was known as the Goddess of Law and Balance. She was very strict in the upholding of the law and could have been seen as intimidating, but was actually quite relaxed and friendly to everyone not breaking the law. Naturally, she got in many fights with [[Keres]], but they had a close relationship regardless and worked together on almost everything. 

She has almost entirely faded from history, but some vague tales of her deeds still persist occasionally, though they are attributed to other nonexistent gods or even humans. She may also be partial inspiration for Kerosyn's name, but it's impossible to know as even he couldn't tell you. 

While she was not responsible for the creation of the chameleon spirits whatsoever, she is largely responsible for how they now act, as they rejected the ways of Grenn and went to her instead. 

Despite most of the other children being allowed to create a type of spirit, Syn chose not to.

Her soul was inherited by [[Neven]].
