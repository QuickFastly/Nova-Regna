## Uriel 

*(Born in 2188 ED. Killed by Samil in 1056 ED. Died 1132 years old.)*

First born of the original creators, he was known as the God of Righteousness. He was even more uptight than Forsete, but had a truly fair and just moral compass, unlike his father. 

He has completely faded from history, with only extremely vague illustrative references remaining in extremely small numbers. 

He was partially responsible for the creation of the wolf spirits. 

His children are [[Ain]] (with [[Irene]]) and [[Minerva]] (with [[Rozan]]).

His soul was inherited by [[Garm]].
