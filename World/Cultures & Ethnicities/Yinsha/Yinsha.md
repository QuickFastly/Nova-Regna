> [!bug] Issue
> This page is a stub, not just because there is much yet to be written, but because the development of this page and its subpages should ideally happen naturally through storytelling, not just worldbuilding. That is a slow process. Until enough detail is added to a given subgroup to be moved to its own page, it will remain here.

> [!example]- Real-world influences
> Of course because there is so much potential detail to be added to pages like these, inspiration must be drawn from somewhere. More subgroups may be added in the future as well, but under specific circumstances. For a lot more detail about all that, check the meta page on [[Appropriate real-world influences|appropriate real-world influences]].

> Here is the abridged version for this page specifically:

> - **Suo** | Inspired by = Malaysia
> - **Xi** | Inspired by = Vietnam
> - **Fa** | Inspired by = Taiwan
> - **Yao** | Inspired by = Hong Kong

> The languages here are listed with their nearest real-world equivalent underneath them. While you can for the most part treat them as 1-to-1 equals, they should still be considered sources of inspiration rather than absolute equivalents, so that we have room to maneuver when making up new stuff. Which you shouldn't be afraid to do, by the way.

The Yinsha people are one of the seven major [[Cultures & Ethnicities|ethnic groups]] of [[Earth|the world]], occupying approximately 6% of the global population, primarily in [[Shaohou]] on the continent of [[Avangia]]. It is also one of the three ethnic and cultural groups that has retained its own prominence to this day since ancient times, even after the ethnogenesis of its numerous subgroups.

They speak Shanyǔ, a distant evolution of the Proto-Shannic language, which has yet to be fully reconstructed. The earliest translated artifacts date back to approximately 7 AO, and they describe in poetic form the confusion felt when suddenly surrounded by people speaking foreign languages, suggesting that some of the oldest ethnic subgroups of the Yinsha may have been present since [[Era Dira]], and may in fact have been more genetically distinct than previously thought, potentially also explaining the particularly extreme linguistic differences among the Yinsha people. 

More TBD

> The places of origin for these subgroups are listed with the current day names of the locations, partially for convenience when looking at the map, mostly because their history is not yet written to have a historical name. When that happens, both will be listed.

### Suo people

</div>

The Suo people are an ethnic group thought to be descended from the [[Yinsha]] that first settled the territory of [[Suwei]] in what is now [[Shaohou]]. Precisely where they came from and when they came to be is still a subject that requires further study, as strong evidence from earlier than approximately the year 7 AO which points to the origins of the Suo people has yet to be discovered. They speak Yáhuà today, which is considered a dialect of Shanyǔ by the Shaohan government, but it retains significant similarity to the extinct native Suo language, which itself shared some similarity to the Taesian language, Talidah, suggesting frequent cultural exchange despite the distance.
