The Reclamation War is an ongoing conflict between [[Destrea]], [[Ustonia]], and [[Shinzen]] that began in 1980. It halted temporarily between 1991 and 1998 due to [[The Big Event]], after which it began again with a surprise attack on the Ustonian capital of [[Northfair]] utilizing stolen [[Nagase]] aircraft from Shinzen.

After the 1972 Ustonian [[Mistletoe Revolution]] took place and Destrea's territory was returned, the states of [[Prestona]] and [[Verace]] defected to Ustonia in 1973, after which an overwhelming military force was stationed on their borders. Destrea spent the next seven years building their case against Ustonia while preparing their military for a full scale invasion, ultimately declaring war claiming that not only were Prestona and Verace rightfully theirs, but all of the land in [[Yulentia]] rightfully belonged to Destrea.

After The Big Event took place in 1991 and the Destrean chain of command and power structure was destroyed by the [[Risky Witches]], the Reclamation War halted as the country struggled with civil war and the Risky Witches while rebuilding its government. During this time, large numbers of covert operatives were spread out all over the world without orders. These operatives spread propaganda, incite civil unrest, steal national secrets and technology, and more, and are still believed to be active today.

In 1998, Destrean operatives in Shinzen revealed the fruits of their labor: Stolen advanced aircraft prototypes from Nagase, each of which was capable of single-handedly overwhelming both Ustonian and Shinzenese air force squadrons and proved to be nigh untouchable during their surprise attack on Northfair. This brought Shinzen into the conflict and turned the tables almost instantly.

At the same time, the Risky Witches came into the possession of one additional stolen Nagase aircraft prototype, along with its pilot, a Shinzenese air force test pilot that discovered the Destrean plan and tried to stop it in any way she could. With the assistance of this pilot and her prototype aircraft, the Risky Witches joined the Reclamation War for a short time and dealt consecutive decisive blows to Destrea, destroying each and every one of the prototype advanced aircraft, then exited the conflict.
