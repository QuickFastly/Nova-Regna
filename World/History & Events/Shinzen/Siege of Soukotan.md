The Siege of Soukotan took place in 1504 and marked the end of the [[History of Shinzen#Ikute period (1253-1504)|Ikute period]].

The capital city of [[Soukotan]] was invaded by the [[Kagetsu Clan]], who forcibly drove out the [[Ikute Clan]] and executed the shogun and his family, dissolving the current shogunate and launching a war of conquest to politically unify [[Shinzen]].
