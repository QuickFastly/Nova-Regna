Deep beneath the surface of the [[Earth]] is a thick layer of ash and charcoal that extends even some distance beyond ocean shores, suggesting that the whole of the planet was on fire for a period of 6 to 8 years. With current technology, we are unable to extract meaningful information from the ash layer itself, and all current methods of measuring the age of organic materials show that everything beneath the ash layer appears to be the same age as the ash, leaving us reliant entirely on the discovery of intact artifacts within or underneath it to learn about the period. Effectively, nearly all of [[Era Dira]] was erased from history.

How this fire could have happened has yet to be explained by any credible scientific theory, and by all counts is blatantly impossible. And yet, it clearly happened. Naturally, the religions and ancient cultures of the world have their own explanations of what supposedly happened.

##### The Children of the Flame

The [[Children of the Flame]], prior to the publishing of [[The Account]], believed that The End of Everything - known to them as "The Inferno" at the time - was the result of the Deliverer killing and burning an entity known as the False One.

Since the publishing of The Account, the accepted belief within the group has changed. They now call it The End of Everything in line with common parlance, and believe that it was caused by [[Kerosyn]], with the help of [[Freya]] and [[Florian]], after receiving divine blessings and orders from the original god, The Creator. They also now believe that it was not ordained to happen only once, but will happen again, and that it may be soon, as written by the god whose name we only know begins with R.
