Shark [[Spirits|spirits]] are a type of major spirit, and make up approximately 3% of all spirits on [[Earth]]. They have existed since [[Era Dira]].

## History

Nothing for now.

### Myths and legends

An oral legend passed down through nearly all shark spirit families for generations describes them as once being the apex predators of the world, craving nothing more than bloodshed. Their people would fight in every war that started without hesitation, unconcerned with the side they were on, just to continue fighting. As the wars got bigger, the shark spirits lost more and more of their people every day until they were nearing extinction.

It was then that [[Kuhai]] stepped in and urged the shark spirits to change. When they refused, Kuhai confronted the enemy alone, absorbing everything the enemy could muster without even lifting a finger. Unfazed, Kuhai delivered a speech both to the enemy and her own people. The enemy halted their attack, and the shark spirits kneeled before them, bringing an end to their senseless violence.

While this story is believed by all shark spirits, other people have countless interpretations of it and the shark spirits don't care enough to clarify, relegating this story to legend. An important factor to note, however, is that this legend is very recent, potentially less than even 500 years old.

## Anatomy & physiology

All shark spirits possess at least one row of razor sharp pointed teeth, but no more than three, a set of gills on the sides of their neck that open underwater, and a tail with a large vertical fin and occasionally additional smaller fins.

Some shark spirits may also have fins protruding from their ears, forearms, calves, or even a dorsal fin on their upper back, all of which will share the same skin coloring and texturing of their tail. Very rarely, some shark spirits may also have shark skin on other parts of their body, typically lower legs, forearms, or the backs of their hands and feet, or even webbed hands.

All shark spirits possess a keen sense of smell on land, but it becomes truly extraordinary when underwater. They are also able to vaguely sense electrical fields, but once again, this perception truly comes into its own when underwater. Naturally, they are all exceptional swimmers.

Shark spirits have significantly stronger bones and muscles than [[Human|humans]], and are typically very lean, causing them to sink quickly in water. They also build muscle at a blistering pace almost effortlessly, making them require a bodybuilder's diet just to survive.

### Life cycle

Shark spirits grow at the same rate as humans, but continue to grow taller for an additional few years, giving them their distinctive towering stature. Around 60 years of age, their hair never turns gray and their skin rarely becomes wrinkled, yet their bodies begin to wither away on the inside. As a result, the most common cause of death among shark spirits (excluding violent causes) is multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

It is theorized that this is caused by their immense everyday energy expenditure becoming too much for their bodies to handle, and that they may be able to live far longer with further advancement of medical technology.

## Geographic distribution

They strongly prefer living near large bodies of water. The majority of them can be found on the southern coasts of [[Destrea]], but they are not an uncommon sight in port towns around the world.

Many can be found in [[Alastor]], where they often serve as volunteer border and coast guards.

## Sociology

Shark spirits are notoriously volatile and angry. Many of them, due to their instinctive inclinations for violence, are hooked to the thrill of fighting, leading them to join the military, where they have a reputation for being a constant source of trouble due to their short fuses and tendency to defy orders.

Outside the military, they often become aimless wanderers, feeling as though their lives have no purpose due to how difficult their instincts make it for them to fit well in society. Over time, they have grown bitter with society at large, making it extremely difficult to make friends with a shark spirit without knowing exactly how to impress them.

There are some rare exceptions to this majority. Shark spirits raised by at least one parent of another species tend to view the world and other people much more positively, and can become quite compassionate and friendly. They can learn to suppress their instincts, which does cause some strange quirks in their behavior, but those quirks bring the unintentional benefit of making them more likable.

### Interracial relations

Shark spirits are typically quick to anger and slow to forgive, so anyone who doesn't immediately make a positive impression with them will likely be on their bad side forever. They don't care about racial differences, but tend to view most people negatively regardless.
