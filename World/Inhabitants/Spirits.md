Spirits are unique variants of [[Human|humans]] characterized by their animalistic features. These can manifest as features from nearly any type of animal on earth, but are typically limited to minor additions or changes to the human body.

They are also notable for having a strong affinity with [[Mystic Matter|mystic matter]].

Despite there likely being a type of spirit for virtually every animal, and even some varieties of plant, only eight types of spirit are notably prominent. These eight varieties of spirit are significantly different from humans and each other, and are referred to as "major spirits".

All other varieties of spirit are referred to as "minor spirits" and are typically much less distinct from humans, even sometimes being hard to distinguish at all from humans or each other, while also making up only a combined ~8.5% of all spirits. Very rare examples may be so extremely different from humans and other spirits that they can appear almost alien.

## History

Spirits have existed on [[Earth]] since [[Era Dira]], as confirmed by the existence of various artifacts dated at over 3000 years old, but there is yet to be a consensus on just how old they are, or their origins.

Throughout the history of the world, spirits have been subject to extreme prejudice. Many believe that this was rooted in fear, but there is little agreement on why it persisted for so long.

Spirits have been victims of multiple genocides, countless hate crimes, and extremely unfair treatment throughout history, and have never had the chance to recover, causing spirits to become an incredibly small minority of all people. To give an idea of just how much they have lost, it is thought that during Era Dira, spirits actually outnumbered humans two to one.

Only in modern times has this extreme prejudice begun to wane as much of human society changes to be more accepting of spirits, though they still struggle. Spirits are often treated with cautious fascination today.

## Anatomy & physiology

Most commonly, spirits possess the ears (or another head feature like antlers, antennae, fins, etc.) of their related animal, and a tail. The eight types of major spirits also all possess major sensory changes similar to their related animals, while minor spirits typically do not.

### Genetics and Reproduction

Spirit genealogy and reproduction works the same way as it does for humans and they remain genetically compatible as a result. However, their genetic strength is weakened, leading most human/spirit offspring to be human.

Two different types of spirit can also reproduce, but the resulting offspring will carry the physical traits of just one parent, and only very rarely inherit other traits from both parents. Hybrids are almost entirely unviable between spirits, and the dominant genes appear to be random. Research has yet to ascertain the cause of this.

## Distribution

Spirits are found all over the world, with certain types preferring certain climates and landscapes. Today, spirits make up approximately 5% of the world population, with major spirits making up approximately 91.5% of all spirits, and minor spirits only 8.5%.
