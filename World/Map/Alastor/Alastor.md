Alastor, officially known as the Commonwealth of the Alastor Isles, is a very small island country on the southern edge of the continent of [[Ozen]]. Its capital, [[Alexandria]], is the central major island of the country. It is neighbored by [[Osun Tanum]], [[Destrea]], and [[Ustonia]].

Alastor is a lightly developed country with the world's smallest population while also having a very high population density, a very weak economy, no industrial sector, and no established military force. They maintain strict diplomatic neutrality towards all things that do not pose a threat to the country, its people, or their way of life.

They have openly expressed their desire to become part of the [[Ozen Federation]] as their support would prove invaluable to the nation, but remain part of the [[Yulentia Trade Union]] under the massive weight of Destrean and Ustonian influence. Despite this, Osun Tanum has negotiated numerous trade deals exclusively with Alastor independent of the Union or Federation.

The nation carries incredible notoriety around the world for being populated almost exclusively by [[Spirits|spirits]] and their extreme reluctance to allow humans inside their borders. Perhaps the most infamous aspect of this reputation comes from when the [[Risky Witches]] swore to protect the nation and its people from all hostilities during [[The Big Event]] in 1991.

## History

Nothing for now.

## Geography

Alastor encompasses an archipelago primarily comprised of three large islands, each with their own very distinct topography and climate. The eastern island, [[Panacea]], is home to a dense, thriving temperate rainforest, and is a sanctuary for many endangered species of fauna. The central island, [[Alexandria]], is a fairly unexceptional temperate seasonal forest region. The western island, [[Electra]], is home to cold desert with almost no natural plant or animal life to be found. The extraordinary states of the eastern and western islands is known to be caused by [[Mystic Matter|mystic matter]] density, but exactly how or why this happened remains a mystery.

## Government & Politics

Alastor is governed by a direct deliberative democracy with no official head of state or other higher authoritative figures. There is an established group of legislators and an established judicial system, but these entities and the people working as part of them are of equal power to the rest of the citizenry, and can be disputed by anyone with a good case.

Any citizen can put forward a proposal, vote on policies, dispute processes, and so on. Technically, all citizens also have the right to perform arrests on suspected criminals or detain otherwise suspicious individuals, which has thoroughly deterred most of the world from attempting to travel there without explicit provable permission.

All governmental decisions are made by majority consensus after multiple gatherings, which happen all over the country twice a week on average, the results of which are sent to the currently elected legislators for review. It is theorized that if this system was adopted anywhere else in the world, the system would collapse under inefficiency, incompetence, or both, but Alastoran citizens are remarkably like-minded and continue to operate the system with remarkable efficiency and competence.

### Military

There is no standing military force in Alastor. The full extent of their military strength is a small number of disarmed and converted helicopters for search and rescue purposes. Not even the national police carry lethal weapons.

## Economy

The Alastoran economy is worth 9.91 trillion CR per year with an expenditure of 78.2%, which is distributed as follows.
- Administration: 9.6%
- Education and Science: 14.3%
- Energy and Environment: 7.1%
- Food and Agriculture: 3.3%
- Healthcare: 18.3%
- Industry: 4%
- International Affairs: 5%
- Law & Order: 5.3%
- Social Policy: 9.7%
- Transportation: 6%
- Welfare: 17.4%

The average income tax rate is 45%. It reaches up to 84% for the super wealthy, and as low as 5% for low income taxpayers. There is a standard 4% sales tax applied universally, and an additional 4% on all luxury items. The average gap between the richest and the poorest citizens is virtually nonexistent.

Businesses are mostly divided between government and community ownership, but small privately owned businesses are still allowed to be run, provided they comply with extremely strict regulations and high taxes associated with the centrally planned economy.

Some primary exports of Alastor are low volume skilled crafts, arts and entertainment, and flowers. Alastor relies heavily on imports to sustain the country. A universal 1% tariff is applied to all imports, plus an additional 1% on luxury items imported from within the Yulentian Trade Union, and 4% outside of it. Many imports from Osun Tanum are exempt from any tariff.

Alastor, being populated almost exclusively by spirits, is of course the most welcoming towards them by far as the entire country is based around and run by them. In fact, while many other countries struggle with discrimination against spirits, Alastor struggles with discrimination against [[Human|humans]], as they are seen by many in the country as their natural enemy, and not everyone can move past that prejudice even if the human in question manages to fully integrate into Alastoran society and proves to be an ally.

Population data according to Alastor foreign relations: ~99% Spirits
- Cat: ~23%
- Wolf: ~21%
- Mouse: ~19%
- Deer: ~16%
- Chameleon: ~7%
- Shark: ~4%
- Crow: ~1%
- Fox: ~1%
- Others: ~8%
- Human: 53,529
