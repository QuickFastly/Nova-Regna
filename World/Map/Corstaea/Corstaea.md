Corstaea, officially known as the Democratic Federation of Corstaea, is a moderately sized country located on the western third of the continent of [[Ozen]], and is a member of the [[Ozen Federation]]. Its capital, [[Østerlund]], is located on the lower eastern coast of the country in the state of [[Vallastad]]. It is bordered by [[Grenneria]] and [[Osun Tanum]].

Corstaea is a well developed country with a relatively large population, a reasonable post-industrial economy, and a moderately sized but highly specialized military. Corstaea is highly renowned for their naval prowess with numerous world-first records to their name, including being the first to sail, first to circumnavigate the globe, and first to construct an all-metal ship, as well as pioneering many naval technologies such as propeller drives, jet drives, submarines, and aircraft carriers. They are the foremost world leader in naval technology to this day.

While the health and happiness of the people are the top priority of Corstaea, the unique parliamentary system of the country struggles with inefficiency and excessive red tape due to the involvement of an aristocracy, each family with their own agendas, all vying for the chance to become the Prime Minister. Though, this internal power struggle also manages to self regulate, as no sweeping changes are made if they would be unfair or detrimental to the common people, and since the majority of people aren't even fully aware of these strange inner workings, the country is considered one of the most desirable places to live in the world.

## History

Nothing for now.

## Geography

Corstaea contains highly varied topography, from flatlands to extreme mountains, but is almost entirely boreal in climate, and is heavily forested in all areas that support it. The [[Sprettekniven Mountains|Sprettekniven]] mountain range spans the entire eastern border of the country.

## Government & Politics

Corstaea is a democratic federal republic under a bicameral parliamentary system. Using a highly adapted model of social democracy, members of the House of Commons are elected by the public and appointed in such a way to maximize representation, while members of the Council are appointed exclusively by the elected Prime Minister. Both houses hold equal power and responsibility to keep each other in check.

The Council has evolved uniquely to support an aristocratic government without compromising fair representation in government. It takes a lot of money to run for Prime Minister, leading the only candidates to be members of any of the various elite, noble, or royal families in the country. The resulting power struggle among this upper class historically led to a system akin to dictatorship, but with the introduction of the House of Commons, they have been able to continue their own internal power struggles without dragging the rest of the country into it. That said, it is also important to note that despite this complication, the country has never experienced oppression or other abuses of power since the introduction of the parliament.

The Council is composed of seven seats with the Prime Minister reigning supreme. The remaining six seats consist of the Minister of Health, Minister of Education, Minister of the State, Minister of Defense, Minister of Energy, and Minister of Commerce.

### Military

The Corstaean military is divided into five main branches, being the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Air Force, and Home Guard. The country enjoyed centuries of absolute naval dominance, and while that dominance has faded in recent years, they still retain their well-earned prestigious naval reputation as their navy is the best trained in the world.

## Economy

The Corstaean economy is worth 292.3 trillion [[Credit (currency)|CR]] per year with an expenditure of 47.3%, which is distributed as follows.
- Administration: 8.1%
- Defense: 6.8%
- Education & Science: 18.8%
- Energy & Environment: 8.7%
- Food & Agriculture: 3.6%
- Healthcare: 11.8%
- Industry: 2.1%
- International Affairs: 6.7%
- Law & Order: 6.3%
- Social Policy: 6.8%
- Transportation: 6.6%
- Welfare: 13.7%

The average income tax rate is 41%, and is much higher for the wealthy, alongside an annual 1% tax on net assets over 5 million CR. There is a universal 17.5% sales tax on all luxury purchases applied by the Ozen Federation, called the OMT or Ozen Maintenance Tax. The average gap between the richest and the poorest citizens is very small.

State owned businesses are common, but most businesses are privately owned and highly diversified. Corporate taxes are relatively high, but not prohibitive, so small businesses still have a chance to thrive in the country.

Some primary exports of Corstaea are cheese, energy technology, and skilled labor. Corstaea applies import tariffs ranging from 2% to 14% depending on the goods imported from any country outside of the Ozen Federation, and no tariffs within it.

Corstaea has the highest known total population of [[Spirits|spirits]] in the world, with over 20,000,000 spirits of several varieties, though the overwhelming majority are wolves with the second most common variety being cats. Precise population information of spirits is not available as Corstaea does not record such information in their census anymore, as part of their aggressive initiative to allow spirits to fully integrate into their society and be free from discrimination. The initiative is showing signs of success as the country is the third most welcoming towards spirits in the world, but it has a ways to go.
