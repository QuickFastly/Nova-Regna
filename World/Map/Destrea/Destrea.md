Destrea, officially known as the Kingdom of Destrea, is an expansive country located on the continent of [[Yulentia]], encompassing its entire eastern half. Its capital, [[Syrres]], is located near the eastern edge of the southern gulf in the prefecture of [[Vaceniza]]. It shares a border with [[Ustonia]] to the west, and is also neighbored by [[Alastor]], [[Grenneria]], and [[Osun Tanum]] across the water to the north.

Destrea is a highly developed country that possesses a large population, a massive industrial sector, extensive infrastructure, and a deeply troubled economy. Destrea is thought to have the world's largest and most formidable standing army, and is both renowned and feared for its many developments in land-based combat.

It was governed by a stratocratic regime since its origins, but as the economy began to crash in early 1980, it quietly became a dictatorship when a high ranking officer gained huge popularity with the citizens by blaming Ustonia for their economic crisis and launching the [[Reclamation War]]. This newfound authoritarianism led to fascism, which bred rebellion, culminating in the rise of the [[Risky Witches]], who dealt a sweeping, crippling blow to the regime on New Year's Day in 1991, now known as [[The Big Event]]. The country is still attempting to recover from this.

## History

TBD

## Geography

Destrea, due to its size, contains hugely varied topography. Through the heart of the country is a huge desert with flat, hilly, and mountainous regions within it. Surrounding the desert is a tropical savanna with forests to the far south, while to the north is a more temperate region, mostly grassland but forested in the far north. There is also a tropical forested archipelago in the southern gulf.

## Government & Politics

Destrea is a despotic stratocratic regime, spearheaded by the commander-in-chief. It is unclear exactly how the commander-in-chief is given power, but their power seems to be supreme and incontestable.

### Administrative divisions

Destrea is divided into 15 prefectures, each governed exclusively by the central military government with no autonomy. Each of these prefectures used to be a sovereign nation before ultimately becoming what is now Destrea, and their unique histories and cultures are still visible. These prefectures are as follows.
- [[Alcaras]]
- [[Baria]]
- [[Begliano]]
- [[Casezzo]]
- [[Espada]]
- [[Filimeni]]
- [[Monzione]]
- [[Mugenno]]
- [[Nalano]]
- [[Rovillo]]
- [[Savorra]]
- [[Selva Luce]]
- [[Tarence]]
- [[Vaceniza]]

### Military

The Destrean military is divided into four branches, being Terra Militare, Marina Militare, Aeronautica Militare, and Militare Suprema. The Terra Militare branch is the world's largest and most formidable standing ground-based military force, while all branches combined are also the world's largest overall military force. While they can easily overwhelm with sheer numbers, their equipment and training among the air and naval forces lags slightly behind many other countries.

### Foreign relations

## Economy

The Destrean economy is worth 1.12 quadrillion [[Credit (currency)|CR]] per year with an expenditure of 91.4%, which is distributed as follows.
- Administration: 10.6%
- Defense: 28.8%
- Education & Science: 6.2%
- Energy & Environment: 1.2%
- Food & Agriculture: 2.2%
- Healthcare: 5.6%
- Industry: 12.2%
- International Affairs: 2.4%
- Law & Order: 20.4%
- Social Policy: 4.3%
- Transportation: 3.3%
- Welfare: 2.8%

The average income tax rate is 69.5%, and can reach up to 93% for the wealthy. There is a universal 22% sales tax applied to the sale of all goods other than food and drink. The average gap between the richest and the poorest citizens is fairly small, but the overwhelming majority of citizens are poor.

Businesses are all publicly owned but subject to extreme regulation and control by the central government. Industry is fairly diverse with a particular focus on the military industrial complex.

Some primary exports of Destrea are weapons manufacturing, heavy industry, and crude oil. Many exports and imports are both heavily restricted by the central government through prohibitive sale prices and import tariffs. The average import tariff on anything excluding essential goods is 36.1%, while essential goods follow the universal rate of the Yulentian Trade Union, being 1% for imports within the union and 4% outside of it.

## Demographics

The Destrean government is extremely prejudiced against [[Spirits|spirits]] and oppresses them heavily. Every spirit is required to carry a unique identifier card with them and renew it every year alongside their regular state identification, and violating this policy in any way can be punishable by death. Much of the public does not share these sentiments and instead views spirits with great pity, but still remain prejudiced in their own way because of this.

Since the occupation of [[Espada]] by the Risky Witches, all records from that state were seized and are no longer accessible. There is an assumption that the actual spirit population is higher than records indicate due to that, the rebellion of 1991, and other criminal activity.

Spirit population according to current state records: 8,550,695
- Cat: 4,531,556
- Chameleon: 112,943
- Shark: 2,612,444
- Crow: 324
- Fox: 2
- Others: 1,293,426

### Education

Education in Destrea is provided in public and private schools and by individuals through homeschooling. Education is compulsory under Destrean law for all children between 6 and 16 years of age, but the standards of education and the levels students are divided into are set by prefectural governments. Public schooling is tuition-free, but all other costs associated with the curriculum are the responsibility of the students and their families.

The public school systems throughout the country are extremely underfunded and are often forced to assign more than double the usual amount of students to each teacher, and private schools, while widely available, are prohibitively expensive for most Destrean families. Both public and private schools place a strong emphasis on nationalism and Destrea-centric history that favors the military, and teaches - intentionally or not - that spirits are lesser beings compared to humans that deserve less. Homeschooling is technically regulated under prefectural law, but inspections are virtually never carried out so long as the students achieve satisfactory results on annual standardized tests.

The Destrean educational system produces the worst average results in the world according to international test score surveys, but the top 10% of students tested often achieve similar scores to the international average.

### Health

Healthcare in Destrea is offered universally as a public service through nationally owned and operated hospitals and clinics, but due to low capacities and long waiting times, a large private sector also thrives in Destrea, and is subject to very light regulation that ensures pricing does not exceed fair values, which are determined by an international regulatory body. Even with the regulated pricing, private healthcare is one of the largest contributors to debt throughout the Destrean population, while simultaneously operating most often with such small profit margins that private hospitals struggle to maintain and acquire modern equipment.

The overall health of Destrean citizens is below average, due to many citizens being unable to receive the care they need in a timely or affordable manner, and widespread poverty causing increased rates of malnutrition and preventable disease.
