Grenneria, officially known as the Grennerian Federation, is a moderately sized country located on the eastern third of the continent of [[Ozen]], and is a member of the [[Ozen Federation]]. Its capital, [[Norizgrad]], is located in the heart of the country near the sea in the province of [[Roslaya]]. It is bordered by [[Corstaea]] and [[Osun Tanum]], and is also closely neighbored by [[Destrea]].

Grenneria is a moderately developed country with a modest population, a troubled industrialized economy, and a modest military. Grenneria is credited for numerous developments in land-based combat strategy and tactics, as well as pioneering the use of gas-operated automatic rifles. However, troubling times befell the country in the mid 20th century and greatly stunted their development, causing them to fall behind technologically. Their strategic prowess still shines despite their obsolete weaponry, allowing them to remain formidable in smaller scale land-based engagements.

Alone, Grenneria is the weakest link of the Ozen Federation, and actively relies on it for aid in areas where the country falls short, but as part of a greater whole, they are still a vital element. For decades, the Grennerian government has often expressed distaste with the policies of the Ozen Federation, but carefully avoids becoming too troublesome under threat of ejection. Conversely, the Ozen Federation does not want to lose Grenneria and works to sustain their people and please their government without compromising the Federation. This delicate balancing act is a huge stressor on the whole Federation.

## History

[[1931 Battle of Himlavård]]

## Geography

Grenneria is encompassed by the [[Himlavård]] mountain range, making nearly half of the land in the region quite mountainous, while the remainder of the land to the east and the south is largely flat with sporadic hills. The whole region is forested with a temperate climate to the south, a boreal climate through the center, and tundra to the north and surrounding the mountains.

## Government & Politics

Grenneria is an electocratic federal republic, split into two branches.

The first branch, the Grennerian Administration, is led by a Prime Minister and at least one Deputy Prime Minster. Beneath them are many Ministers dedicated to specific departments of government, such as agriculture, defense, education, and so on. Citizens elect Ministers from a pool of candidates recommended by the Deputy Prime Ministers, and elect Deputy Prime Ministers from a pool of candidates recommended by the Prime Minister. Citizens can also elect a President, who is technically not part of the Administration, but is the one responsible for appointing the Prime Minister.

The second branch, the Grennerian Council, is an independent entity formed to monitor the activities of the Administration and ensure that they are carried out in a timely manner and in accordance with the constitution. The President is the head of this organization and is responsible for appointing everyone in it, ultimately leaving much of the country's governance in a shadowy gray zone. This model garners much criticism, but you will be hard pressed to find a Grennerian citizen voicing such criticism in their own country.

### Administrative divisions

Grenneria is divided into eight provinces, each overseen by at least one minister per department of the Administration. The provinces are governed exclusively by the Administration and have no autonomy, though they all have very distinct history and culture. These provinces are as follows.
- [[Ivashni]]
- [[Khotka]]
- [[Kielda]]
- [[Markask]]
- [[Nazavat]]
- [[Roslaya]]
- [[Sarabey]]
- [[Ulavyr]]

### Military

The Grennerian military is divided into four branches, being the Ground Forces, Navy, Air Force, and Airborne Troops. Their naval and air forces are small, weak, and rather poorly trained and equipped, but their ground forces, while still being rather poorly equipped compared to the rest of the world, receive world-class training. The Airborne Troops branch was created to fill a strategic gap to the best of the country's ability by making use of the weak air forces to drop elite ground units directly into advantageous positions in battle.

### Foreign relations

## Economy

The Grennerian economy is worth 112.7 trillion [[Credit (currency)|CR]] per year with an expenditure of 61.2%, which is distributed as follows.
- Administration: 9.6%
- Defense: 14.7%
- Education & Science: 7.8%
- Energy & Environment: 3.6%
- Food & Agriculture: 5.9%
- Healthcare: 7.4%
- Industry: 12.5%
- International Affairs: 5.9%
- Law & Order: 9.5%
- Social Policy: 6.3%
- Transportation: 8.9%
- Welfare: 7.9%

The average income tax rate is 30%, and is much higher for the wealthy, though that doesn't tell the whole story as the minimum amount of income a citizen must make before being taxed is relatively high. There is a universal 17.5% sales tax on all luxury purchases applied by the Ozen Federation, called the OMT or Ozen Maintenance Tax. The average gap between the richest and the poorest citizens is rather small, but both extreme ends of the spectrum are immensely far apart.

A large portion of business and industry is government owned and centrally planned, but the majority of businesses are privatized and allowed to follow the market economy. Corporate taxes are quite high and are prohibitive for most entrepreneurial individuals, but not too much to drive away big business. There is also known to be an expansive black market throughout the country, but further details are not available.

Some primary exports of Grenneria are manufacturing, unskilled labor, and lumber. Grenneria relies in part on imports to sustain the country, and applies import tariffs ranging from nothing to 40% depending on the goods and from where they were imported, and applies no tariffs to any goods imported from within the Ozen Federation.

## Demographics

Grenneria has historically acted towards [[Spirits|spirits]] with hostility while publicly feigning total ignorance. While the overt hostility has ceased, the government still operates as though spirits don't exist at all, leading to severe systemic discrimination against them. On top of this, many Grennerian people treat spirits as objects of fascination more than individuals. It is assumed that the spirit population of the country is very small as a result, but there is no concrete information to investigate this.

### Education

Education in Grenneria is provided primarily by public schools, which are tuition-free and provide all required educational materials, appropriate clothing or uniforms, and lunches to their students free of charge regardless of economic status. The Grennerian system is divided into four levels, being preschool education (ages 6 and under), primary general education (ages 6 to 10), basic general education (ages 11-16), and secondary general education (ages 17-18).

Private schools exist, but are strictly regulated and are rare as a result. Private schools are only legally permitted to operate if they provide a significantly unique alternative method of education that has been proven to produce satisfactory results. Families below a certain threshold of economic status are entitled to financial grants from the Ozen Federation to allow them to select a private school if they wish.

Education standards are set by the Minister of Education and their board of advisors, with additional input from other ministers every five years to determine if there is any need for increased or reduced focus on things like economics, vocational education, military history, and politics. Students may also elect independently to enroll in post-secondary education of various types, from vocational schools to universities.

The Grennerian educational system produces poor results, with 4th, 8th, and 12th grade students consistently being ranked 8th in international test score surveys, but it has been noted that these surveys may be a flawed representation of the Grennerian model, as Grennerian students are typically high achievers in their chosen fields but underachievers in most other fields.

### Health

Healthcare in Grenneria is provided universally to all citizens of the Ozen Federation, primarily through nationally owned and operated hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies, all of which are paid with tax revenue and therefore do not charge patients at all for any care they receive. Privately owned alternatives exist, but are legally required to be operated as non-profit businesses and are subject to extreme regulation to ensure that all patients of any economic status can receive equal levels of care, with the Ozen Federation providing financial support to those that cannot afford the allowed charges from these businesses.

The overall health of Grennerian citizens is average.
