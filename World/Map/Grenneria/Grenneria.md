Grenneria, officially known as the Grennerian Federation, is a moderately sized country located on the eastern third of the continent of [[Ozen]], and is a member of the [[Ozen Federation]]. Its capital, [[Norizgrad]], is located in the heart of the country near the sea in the province of [[Roslaya]]. It is bordered by [[Corstaea]] and [[Osun Tanum]], and is also closely neighbored by [[Destrea]].

Grenneria is a moderately developed country with a modest population, a troubled industrialized economy, and a modest military. Grenneria is credited for numerous developments in land-based combat strategy and tactics, as well as pioneering the use of gas-operated automatic rifles. However, troubling times befell the country in the early 20th century and greatly stunted their development, causing them to fall behind technologically. Their strategic prowess still shines despite their obsolete weaponry, allowing them to remain formidable in smaller scale land-based engagements.

Alone, Grenneria is the weakest link of the Ozen Federation, and actively relies on it for aid in areas where the country falls short, but as part of a greater whole, they are still a vital element. For decades, the Grennerian government has often expressed distaste with the policies of the Ozen Federation, but carefully avoids becoming too troublesome under threat of ejection. Conversely, the Ozen Federation does not want to lose Grenneria and works to sustain their people and please their government without compromising the Federation. This delicate balancing act is a huge stressor on the whole Federation.

## History

Nothing for now

## Geography

Grenneria is an almost entirely flat region with the exception of the lower half of the [[Sprettekniven Mountains|Sprettekniven]] mountain range cutting through it. The whole region is forested with a temperate climate to the south, a boreal climate through the center, and tundra to the north and surrounding the mountains.

## Government & Politics

Grenneria is an electocratic federal republic, split into two branches.

The first branch, the Grennerian Administration, is led by a Prime Minister and at least one Deputy Prime Minster. Beneath them are many Ministers dedicated to specific departments of government, such as agriculture, defense, education, and so on. Citizens elect Ministers from a pool of candidates recommended by the Deputy Prime Ministers, and elect Deputy Prime Ministers from a pool of candidates recommended by the Prime Minister. Citizens can also elect a President, who is technically not part of the Administration, but is the one responsible for appointing the Prime Minister.

The second branch, the Grennerian Council, is an independent entity formed to monitor the activities of the Administration and ensure that they are carried out in a timely manner and in accordance with the constitution. The President is the head of this organization and is responsible for appointing everyone in it, ultimately leaving much of the country's governance in a shadowy gray zone. This model garners much criticism, but you will be hard pressed to find a Grennerian citizen voicing such things.

### Administrative divisions

Grenneria is divided into eight provinces, each overseen by at least one minister per department of the Administration. The provinces are governed exclusively by the Administration and have no autonomy, though they all have very distinct history and culture. These provinces are as follows.
- [[Ivashni]]
- [[Khotka]]
- [[Kielda]]
- [[Markask]]
- [[Nazavat]]
- [[Roslaya]]
- [[Sarabey]]
- [[Ulavyr]]

### Military

The Grennerian military is divided into four branches, being the Ground Forces, Navy, Air Force, and Airborne Troops. Their naval and air forces are small, weak, and rather poorly trained and equipped, but their ground forces, while still being rather poorly equipped compared to the rest of the world, receive world-class training. The Airborne Troops branch was created to fill a strategic gap to the best of the country's ability by making use of the weak air forces to drop elite ground units directly into advantageous positions in battle.

## Economy

The Grennerian economy is worth 112.7 trillion [[Credit (currency)|CR]] per year with an expenditure of 61.2%, which is distributed as follows.
- Administration: 9.6%
- Defense: 14.7%
- Education & Science: 7.8%
- Energy & Environment: 3.6%
- Food & Agriculture: 5.9%
- Healthcare: 7.4%
- Industry: 12.5%
- International Affairs: 5.9%
- Law & Order: 9.5%
- Social Policy: 6.3%
- Transportation: 8.9%
- Welfare: 7.9%

The average income tax rate is 30%, and is much higher for the wealthy, though that doesn't tell the whole story as the minimum amount of income a citizen must make before being taxed is relatively high. There is a universal 17.5% sales tax on all luxury purchases applied by the Ozen Federation, called the OMT or Ozen Maintenance Tax. The average gap between the richest and the poorest citizens is rather small, but both extreme ends of the spectrum are immensely far apart.

A large portion of business and industry is government owned and centrally planned, but the majority of businesses are privatized and allowed to follow the market economy. Corporate taxes are quite high and are prohibitive for most entrepreneurial individuals, but not too much to drive away big business. There is also known to be an expansive black market throughout the country, but further details are not available.

Some primary exports of Grenneria are manufacturing, unskilled labor, and raw metals. Grenneria relies in part on imports to sustain the country, and applies import tariffs ranging from nothing to 40% depending on the goods and from where they were imported, and applies no tariffs to any goods imported from within the Ozen Federation.

Grenneria has historically acted towards [[Spirits|spirits]] with total ignorance, and continues to do so today. The government operates as though spirits don't exist at all, leading to severe systemic discrimination against them. On top of this, many Grennerian people treat spirits as objects of fascination more than individuals. It is assumed that the spirit population of the country is very small as a result, but there is no concrete information to investigate this.
