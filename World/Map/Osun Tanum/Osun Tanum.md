Osun Tanum, officially known as the Democratic Republic of Osun Tanum, is a moderately sized country located on the southern third of the continent of [[Ozen]], and is a member of the [[Ozen Federation]]. Its capital, [[Grendelholt]], is located in the center of the country near the sea in the state of [[Sondergård]]. It is bordered by [[Corstaea]], [[Grenneria]], and [[Ustonia]], and is also closely neighbored by [[Alastor]] and [[Destrea]].

Osun Tanum is a well developed country with a modest population, a weak but stable post-industrial economy, and a small but very well outfitted military. Osun Tanum is famously recognized as the world's foremost leader in the aerospace sector with countless world-first records to their name, including being the first to fly, first to exit the atmosphere, first to successfully deploy a satellite, and first to land on the moon. They also were the primary contributor to the [[Global Space Platform]], and are currently developing a space elevator. All the while, their in-atmosphere developments are also second to none. Pilots trained in Osun Tanum are near-universally at the top of their class, and many of the finest aircraft in the world of many different varieties come from the country as well.

Osun Tanum's model of social democracy is considered the global benchmark of efficiency and fairness, and their welfare, healthcare, and education programs are remarkably far ahead of the rest of the world. It is the only country in the world to have solved the problems of homelessness and unemployment. While Osun Tanum still has numerous problems, its citizens are the happiest and healthiest in the world.

The country has remained non-aggressive to a fault, even losing over 80% of their territory to Ustonia during their time of rampant expansionism, and allowing them to retain a portion of it during peace negotiations.

## History

TBD

## Geography

Osun Tanum is an almost entirely temperate region with forests throughout most of it, several large rivers, and a fairly equal distribution of flatlands and rolling hills. [[Himlavård]] runs across much of the northern border of the country.

## Government & Politics

Osun Tanum is a democratic federal republic with a unique mixture of political systems across the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, having both a presidential system and a parliamentary system simultaneously.

It's a highly complex system and can be confusing to foreigners, but has been highly optimized and made efficient through centuries of use. As participation is so important to the system and representation is so high, policies grew simpler and easier to understand, political education was drastically improved, and adaptations were made to keep the public as well and fairly informed as possible. As a result, while a foreigner will likely be confused by the complex layers and many civic responsibilities, you can count on any native citizen of Osun Tanum to be both well educated and informed, and well equipped to act with that in mind.

### Administrative divisions

Osun Tanum is divided into six states, each with their own state government overseen by an elected governor with limited autonomy under the federal government, along with a set of elected parliamentary representatives. Each state has their own unique history and culture, which greatly influences legislature. These states are as follows.
- [[Elgård]]
- [[Kolgård]]
- [[Macdon]]
- [[Osterfeld]]
- [[Sondergård]]
- [[Vastdal]]

### Military

The military of Osun Tanum is divided into four branches, being the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Home Guard. Their numbers are small, particularly in the navy, but they are very well trained and equipped. Osun Tanum also prides itself on having the best trained air force in the world, with many of their pilots being capable of downing aircraft a generation newer than their own. The only nation that stands a chance against Osun Tanum in the air is Shinzen with their highly competitive training plus advanced aircraft.

More than any other nation, Osun Tanum is extremely dedicated to international peacekeeping efforts, often deploying so many of their forces that the Home Guard branch is necessary just to prevent leaving the country defenseless.

## Economy

The economy of Osun Tanum is worth 133.4 trillion [[Credit (currency)|CR]] per year with an expenditure of 39.8%, which is distributed as follows.
- Administration: 10.3%
- Defense: 5.7%
- Education & Science: 14.2%
- Energy & Environment: 7.9%
- Food & Agriculture: 3.8%
- Healthcare: 11.6%
- Industry: 3.3%
- International Affairs: 8.3%
- Law & Order: 7%
- Social Policy: 7.3%
- Transportation: 6%
- Welfare: 14.6%

The average income tax rate is 55%, but can be as low as 5.25% for low income taxpayers, and the wealthy are taxed in various other ways rather than with a higher income tax rate. There is a universal 17.5% sales tax on all luxury purchases applied by the Ozen Federation, called the OMT or Ozen Maintenance Tax. The average gap between the richest and the poorest citizens is fairly small.

Many essential services such as education, welfare, healthcare, and other such things are federally owned and provided at little to no charge, while all other business is privatized and strictly regulated to prevent monopolies and unfair dealing. Corporate and business taxes are variable according to the size of the business, creating as level of a playing field as possible.

Some primary exports of Osun Tanum are aerospace technology, wine, and organic foods. Osun Tanum applies import tariffs ranging from 1% to 12% depending on the goods imported from any country outside of the Ozen Federation, and no tariffs within it.

## Demographics

Osun Tanum has a very high population of [[Spirits|spirits]] and is extremely welcoming towards them, largely following in the footsteps of Corstaea to raise awareness and acceptance as well as reduce discrimination. However, the country has not gone so far as to remove spirit identification from the census entirely, like Corstaea has done, much to the delight of statisticians the world over.

Spirit population according to the 2030 census: 19,614,205
- Cat: 7,447,121
- Wolf: 1,523,872
- Mouse: 8,325,399
- Deer: 239,743
- Chameleon: 21,674
- Shark: 45,925
- Crow: 7,223
- Fox: 1,731
- Others: 2,001,427

It is suspected that there are many more spirits than this in the country, but it is impossible to verify. Many spirits are known to hide their identity on paper, hide it completely from everyone, or go so far as to live off the grid out of either fear or preference.

### Education

Education in Osun Tanum is provided primarily by public schools, which are tuition-free and provide all required educational materials, appropriate clothing or uniforms, and lunches to their students free of charge regardless of economic status. The Tanish school system is typically divided into three levels, being elementary (grades 1-7), lower secondary (grades 7-10), and upper secondary (grades VG1-VG3). Elementary and lower secondary education are compulsory under Tanish law.

Private schools exist, but are strictly regulated and are rare as a result. Private schools are only legally permitted to operate if they provide a significantly unique alternative method of education that has been proven to produce satisfactory results. Families below a certain threshold of economic status are entitled to financial grants from the Ozen Federation to allow them to select a private school if they wish.

Education standards, including the preferred methods and schedules used in public schools, are managed collaboratively between the Tanish government and student representatives of all ages from all six states, leading to Tanish students spending less time in schools than students anywhere else in the world, the abolishment of homework, and significant reductions in time spent on common courses, instead favoring a wide range of courses focused on real-world skills.

The educational system of Osun Tanum produces the best results in the world according to both international test score surveys and independent short and long term surveys of student happiness.

### Health

Healthcare in Osun Tanum is provided universally to all citizens of the Ozen Federation, primarily through nationally owned and operated hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies, all of which are paid with tax revenue and therefore do not charge patients at all for any care they receive. Privately owned alternatives exist, but are legally required to be operated as non-profit businesses and are subject to extreme regulation to ensure that all patients of any economic status can receive equal levels of care, with the Ozen Federation providing financial support to those that cannot afford the allowed charges from these businesses.

The overall health of Tanish citizens is excellent.
