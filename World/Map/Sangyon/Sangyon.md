Sangyon, officially known as the People's Republic of Sangyon, is a small country encompassing the northern archipelago of the continent of [[Avangia]]. Its capital, [[Dangje]], is located in the center of the country on the main island. It is closely neighbored by [[Shinzen]] to the south, separated by a large strait.

Sangyon is a highly developed country with a small but incredibly dense population, a reasonable post-industrial economy, extensive infrastructure, and a small but well outfitted military kept exclusively for defensive purposes. Sangyon is known most famously for its beautiful, lush, undisturbed landscapes, balanced in delicate harmony with its massive, bustling city centers, making the country a global tourist favorite. It is also considered one of the world leaders in the development of robotics, microelectronics, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology, in close competition with Shinzen despite its incredible disadvantages in population and spending power.

Even in times of war, the country has always remained optimistically focused on furthering its research of peaceful technologies for the benefit of its citizens, and enjoys its resulting reputation as a shining beacon of peace and progress, reflected in their flag today.

## History

Nothing for now.

## Geography

Sangyon is divided fairly equally into a temperate rainforest in the south, boreal forest in the north, and temperate seasonal forest in the middle. The topography is mostly flat with some shallow hills. The most unique aspect of Sangyon's geography is in the water, as it is surrounded by all three of the world's oceans, plus many beautiful and unique oceanographic features, and is home to a very diverse underwater ecosystem.

## Government & Politics

Sangyon is a unitary republic under constitutional monarchy, in which the power of the Emperor is limited to ceremonial and symbolic capacities. Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Sangyon and the Cabinet.

The country follows a remarkably similar system of government as Shinzen, as it was Shinzen that assisted in the reformation of the government of Sangyon, but it has been adapted to fit the needs of the country by minimizing inefficient bureaucratic divisions and departments, instead placing more power directly into the hands of Parliament, most obviously being their structure as a unitary state rather than a federation.

### Administrative divisions

The country is divided into 16 prefectures, many of which are their own islands. These prefectures are controlled by the central government with no autonomy, instead having a set of locally elected representatives to petition the central government on issues. These states are as follows.
- [[Cheosu]]
- [[Dangje]]
- [[Gangsu]]
- [[Gwasu]]
- [[Haesu]]
- [[Jeonsan]]
- [[Kimje]]
- [[Kimsong]]
- [[Manjin]]
- [[Ranan]]
- [[Rasan]]
- [[Rawang]]
- [[Sinju]]
- [[Tanbaek]]
- [[Tanje]]
- [[Wonsan]]

### Judicial branch

The Supreme Court of Sangyon and other interior courts operate independently from the executive and legislative branches of government and keep them in check.

### Military

The military of Sangyon, better known as the Republic of Sangyon Armed forces or ROSA, is divided into three main branches, being the Army, Navy, and Air Force. They are technologically one generation behind the rest of the world and are incredible few in numbers, but are well trained for defense operations.

## Economy

The economy of Sangyon is worth 119.3 trillion [[Credit (currency)|CR]] per year with an expenditure of 38.1%, which is distributed as follows.
- Administration: 13%
- Defense: 1.2%
- Education & Science: 21.5%
- Energy & Environment: 12.1%
- Food & Agriculture: 2.1%
- Healthcare: 9.9%
- Industry: 6.2%
- International Affairs: 3.1%
- Law & Order: 7.4%
- Social Policy: 3.1%
- Transportation: 6.8%
- Welfare: 13.6%

The average income tax rate is 20.9%. It reaches up to 44% for the wealthy, and as low as 6% for low income taxpayers. There is a flat 10% sales tax on all goods and services sold, excluding certain exceptions, such as educational materials. The average gap between the richest and the poorest citizens is moderate, and the majority of citizens are middle class.

Many scientific and educational institutions are state owned, along with most welfare and social services, but the vast majority of business is privatized and strictly regulated to prevent monopolies and unfair dealing, as well as to protect the surrounding environment and enforce emissions standards. Corporate taxes are high, but there are a wealth of tax credits available as rewards for various things such as carbon neutral operation, providing equal opportunities, conducting valuable research, and so on.

The largest contributor to the economy of Sangyon is the tourism industry, but some other significant contributions include the export of research, robotics, and fish. Sangyon applies import tariffs ranging between 1.2% and 22% depending on the goods, and from where they were imported.

Sangyon experiences nearly the opposite problem as Shinzen regarding [[Spirits|spirit]] acceptance. Systemic discrimination is nonexistent and spirits technically have absolute equality with humans in the country, but societal discrimination still runs rampant as many people are overly wary based on outdated ideas, old stories, and xenophobia. A happy spirit is a rare sight in Sangyon.

Spirit population as of the 2030 census: 7,075,287
- Cat: 4,835,200
- Wolf: 741,253
- Mouse: 192,236
- Deer: 712,412
- Chameleon: 125,231
- Shark: 13,687
- Crow: 11,102
- Fox: 7,432
- Others: 436,734

It is suspected that there are many more spirits than this in the country, but it is impossible to verify. Many spirits are known to hide their identity on paper, hide it completely from everyone, or go so far as to live off the grid out of either fear or preference.
