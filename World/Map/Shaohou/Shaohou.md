Shaohou, officially known as the Imperial Lands of Shaohou, is a relatively small country located on the continent of [[Avangia]]. Its capital, [[Hangjing]], is located in the extremely mountainous heart of the country in the [[Qihua]] territory. It is encircled by a land border with [[Shinzen]].
%% Hangjing coordinates: 29째19'W 125째1'S (?) %%

Shaohou is a poorly developed country with a modest population, a deeply troubled economy with massive agricultural and industrial sectors, poor infrastructure, and a large but poorly outfitted military. Shaohou is also known for its extreme restrictions on both civil rights and political freedoms, and for its incredibly cheap manufacturing and engineering labor exports.

Bitter rivals with Shinzen since time immemorial, Shaohou dedicated itself almost entirely to defeating Shinzen for centuries - even during times of peace - ultimately holding back the development of the country drastically. While Shinzen continued to dominate and eventually adopted a peaceful ideology, Shaohou never moved beyond its militaristic imperial ideology or its corrupt dynasties, and continues to stagnate as a result.

## History

Nothing for now.

## Geography

Shaohou contains extremely varied topography despite its size, with nearly every non-arctic biome other than the boreal forest being visible in the country, along with everything from vast flatlands to the second tallest mountain in the world.

## Government & Politics

Shaohou is a dynastic absolute monarchy, also bordering on military rule as different dynasties squabble for power. The Emperor holds absolute power and stands above the law. Beneath the Emperor are three departments and six ministries to handle their respective areas of governance on behalf of, but still subject to supervision and approval from the Emperor.

The Department of Chancellery controls the Ministry of Personnel, responsible for civil affairs, and the Ministry of Revenue, responsible for the management of the economy. The Department of State Affairs controls the Ministry of Rites, responsible for interior affairs, foreign relations, and ceremonial affairs, and the Ministry of Defense, responsible for management of the military. Finally, the Secretariat controls the Ministry of Justice, responsible for judicial and penal affairs, and the People's Ministry, responsible for management of infrastructure and state-owned production and manufacturing.

### Administrative divisions

The country is divided into six territories, all under the control of the ruling dynasty. These territories are as follows.
- [[Nanjiang]]
- [[Qihua]]
- [[Suwei]]
- [[Xinshu]]
- [[Xinwei]]
- [[Yuezou]]

%% Rename Naransai to Xinwei? Sagana to Yuezou? Mianshui to Nanjiang? Mianrao to Qihua? %%

### Military

The Shaohan military, better known as the People's Protection Army or PPA, is divided into three primary branches, being the PPA Ground Forces, PPA Navy, and PPA Air Force. While its army is comparatively large, the vast majority of it is in the Ground Forces, and the entire military is one to two full generations behind the rest of the world, both technologically and in training, as a direct result of the country's centuries of stagnation.

## Economy

The economy of Shaohou is worth 84.2 trillion [[Credit (currency)|CR]] per year with an expenditure of 83.4%, which is distributed as follows.
- Administration: 16.4%
- Defense: 18.5%
- Education & Science: 5.6%
- Energy & Environment: 4.5%
- Food & Agriculture: 6.7%
- Healthcare: 7.6%
- Industry: 13.2%
- International Affairs: 0.6%
- Law & Order: 14%
- Social Policy: 4.3%
- Transportation: 6.1%
- Welfare: 2.5%

The average income tax rate is 61.7%, and much higher for the wealthy, though the ruling dynasty is exempt. There is no sales tax, and no tax on liquid assets. The gap between the richest and the poorest citizens is virtually nonexistent, excluding the ruling dynasty and other powerful dynasties, which are all unfathomably richer than the rest of the population.

Nearly all businesses providing essential goods and services are state owned, and nearly all businesses providing non-essential goods and services are privately owned, but exceptions exist on both sides. The corporate tax rate is a flat 25% regardless of size or income, and all businesses are extremely heavily regulated to follow the centrally planned economy.

Some primary exports of Shaohou are unskilled labor, manufacturing, and agricultural products. Shaohou applies import tariffs ranging between 1% and 10% depending on the goods, and from where they were imported.

## Demographics

- [[Yinsha]]: 96%
	- [[East Yinsha|East]]: 62%
	- [[West Yinsha|West]]: 38%
- Others: 4%

Shaohou is extremely prejudiced against [[Spirits|spirits]], systemically and societally, leading to extreme oppression in addition to the already great challenges associated with living under Shaohan rule. Accurate statistics are not available for spirit population even though it is known that the country keeps track of them.
