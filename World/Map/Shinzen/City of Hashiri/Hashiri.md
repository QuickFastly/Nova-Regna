Hashiri is a designated city[^1] located in the state of [[Sumitori]] in [[Shinzen]]. the third largest city in Shinzen by population, behind [[Soukotan]] and [[Takagawa]]. It is widely known throughout the country for its extensive and complex expressway network, and around the world for its towering commercial districts that make it a tourism hotspot.

The Kanjō ward includes the towns of [[Ginya]], [[Sanzan]], [[Wahara]], [[Yurihama]], and [[Ryōgan]].

[^1]: I'm not writing my own page for what a designated city is. At least not yet. Look at [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities_designated_by_government_ordinance_of_Japan) instead. It also explains what a ward is in this context.
