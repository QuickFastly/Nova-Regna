Shinzen, officially known as the State of Shinzen (真善国), is an expansive country and international superpower located on the continent of [[Avangia]]. Its capital, [[Takagawa]], is located near the southern coast of the state of [[Asahi]]. It is bordered by [[Shaohou]] to the west, and closely neighbored by [[Sangyon]] to the northwest and [[Ilmaria]] off the eastern coast.
%% Takagawa coordinates: La. -10°8' Lo. -37°28' (?) %%

Shinzen is a highly developed nation with the second largest population in the world, a booming semi-industrial economy, and a very well outfitted military. Shinzen is also considered to be one of the world leaders in aviation and automotive engineering, as well as development in space travel, robotics, microelectronics, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology.

## History

Nothing for now. [[History of Shinzen]] for later.

## Geography

Well over half of Shinzen is covered in dense, untouched forests, rolling hills, and mountains. The whole country minus the state of [[Kenshiri]] has a tropical climate. Rivers are extremely prevalent in the country and even flow directly through many cities. Shinzen is also home to the most diverse ecology in the world, and is revered for its natural beauty.

## Government & Politics

Shinzen is a federal republic under constitutional monarchy, in which the power of the Emperor is limited to ceremonial and symbolic capacities. Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Shinzen and the Cabinet.

### Administrative divisions

The country is divided into 11 states, each with their own state government overseen by an elected governor with some degree of autonomy under the federal government, most with their own unique cultural views that influence their legislation. These states are as follows.
- [[Asahi]]
- [[Futou]]
- [[Hayagawa]]
- [[Kenshiri]]
- [[Kiyoshiri]]
- [[Kuminachi]]
- [[Miwae]]
- [[Okina]]
- [[Onsai]]
- [[Sumitori]]
- [[Tozawa]]

### Legislative branch

The National Diet is a bicameral entity comprised of representatives directly elected by the people.

### Judicial branch

The Supreme Court of Shinzen and other interior courts operate independently from the executive and legislative branches of government and keep them in check.

### Military

The Shinzenese military, better known as the Shinzen Regional Defense Forces or SRDF, is divided into three primary branches, being the Ground Force, Maritime Force, and Air Force. What they lack in numbers, they make up for with cutting edge technology and training that is second to none, and their particular emphasis on aviation has led them to have the world's most formidable air force.

## Economy

The economy of Shinzen is worth 2.25 quadrillion [[Credit (currency)|CR]] per year with an expenditure of 24.8%, distributed as follows.
- Administration: 2.8%
- Defense: 3.1%
- Education & Science: 19.3%
- Energy & Environment: 6.4%
- Food & Agriculture: 1.3%
- Healthcare: 21.1%
- Industry: 1.8%
- International Affairs: 7.8%
- Law & Order: 6.1%
- Social Policy: 6.3%
- Transportation: 3.8%
- Welfare: 20.2%

The average income tax rate is 23%. It reaches up to 55% for the wealthy, and as low as 9% for low income taxpayers. There is a flat 10% sales tax on all goods sold except food, which is 8%, and there is a road tax determined by miles traveled each year, fully automatically. The average gap between the richest and the poorest citizens is moderate, but both extreme ends of the spectrum are incredibly far apart.

All infrastructure, educational institutions, social services, and welfare organizations are state owned, while all other businesses are privatized, but all primarily follow the market economy alongside a contingency plan managed by the state. The corporate tax rate is a fixed 10.9% plus separate duties or penalties depending on the type of business and how it's structured and managed.

Some primary exports of Shinzen are electronics, cars and trucks, and biotechnology. Shinzen applies import tariffs ranging between 4.7% and 41% depending on the goods, and from where they were imported.

## Demographics

- [[Shisuya]]: 89%
	- [[North Shisuya|North]]: 78%
	- [[South Shisuya|South]]: 22%
- [[East Yinsha|Yinsha (East)]]: 7%
- Others: 4%

Shinzen has a unique struggle with acceptance of [[Spirits|spirits]], as their official stance is a welcoming one and most people in the country are openly accepting and supportive of spirits, but systemic discrimination still remains, particularly in education and career opportunities. Nevertheless, many spirits are quite happy with their treatment in Shinzen, even though they have fewer opportunities.

Spirit population as of the 2030 census: 14,158,605
- Cat: 8,312,945
- Wolf: 121,004
- Mouse: 243,211
- Deer: 4,298,433
- Chameleon: 550,753
- Shark: 73,231
- Crow: 9,199
- Fox: 13,423
- Others: 536,406

It is suspected that there are many more spirits than this in the country, but it is impossible to verify. Many spirits are known to hide their identity on paper, hide it completely from everyone, or go so far as to live off the grid out of either fear or preference.
