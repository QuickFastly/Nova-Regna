Shinzen, officially known as the State of Shinzen (真善国), is an expansive country and international superpower located on the continent of [[Avangia]]. Its capital, [[Takagawa]], is located near the southern coast of the state of [[Asahi]]. It is bordered by [[Shaohou]] to the west, and closely neighbored by [[Sangyon]] to the northwest and [[Ilmaria]] in the eastern gulf.

Shinzen is a highly developed nation with the second largest population in the world, a booming semi-industrial economy, and a very well outfitted military. Shinzen is also considered to be one of the world leaders in aviation and automotive engineering, as well as development in space travel, robotics, microelectronics, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology.

## History

Nothing for now. [[History of Shinzen]] for later.

## Geography

Well over half of Shinzen is covered in dense, untouched forests, rolling hills, and mountains. The whole country has a tropical climate, except for the state of [[Kenshiri]] which is temperate. Rivers are extremely prevalent in the country and even flow directly through many cities. Shinzen is also home to the most diverse ecology in the world, and is revered for its natural beauty.

## Government & Politics

Shinzen is a federal republic under constitutional monarchy, in which the power of the Emperor is limited to ceremonial and symbolic capacities. Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Shinzen and the Cabinet.

### Administrative divisions

The country is divided into 11 states, each with their own state government overseen by an elected governor with some degree of autonomy under the federal government, most with their own unique cultural views that influence their legislation. These states are as follows.
- [[Asahi]]
- [[Futou]]
- [[Hayagawa]]
- [[Kenshiri]]
- [[Kiyoshiri]]
- [[Kuminachi]]
- [[Miwae]]
- [[Okina]]
- [[Onsai]]
- [[Sumitori]]
- [[Tozawa]]

### Military

The Shinzenese military, better known as the Shinzen Regional Defense Forces or SRDF, is divided into three primary branches, being the Ground Force, Maritime Force, and Air Force. What they lack in numbers, they make up for with cutting edge technology and training that is second to none, and their particular emphasis on aviation has led them to have the world's most formidable air force.

### Foreign relations

## Economy

The economy of Shinzen is worth 2.25 quadrillion [[Credit (currency)|CR]] per year with an expenditure of 24.8%, distributed as follows.
- Administration: 2.8%
- Defense: 3.1%
- Education & Science: 19.3%
- Energy & Environment: 6.4%
- Food & Agriculture: 1.3%
- Healthcare: 21.1%
- Industry: 1.8%
- International Affairs: 7.8%
- Law & Order: 6.1%
- Social Policy: 6.3%
- Transportation: 3.8%
- Welfare: 20.2%

The average income tax rate is 23%. It reaches up to 55% for the wealthy, and as low as 9% for low income taxpayers. There is a flat 10% sales tax on all goods sold except food, which is 8%, and there is a road tax determined by miles traveled each year, fully automatically. The average gap between the richest and the poorest citizens is moderate, but both extreme ends of the spectrum are incredibly far apart.

All infrastructure, educational institutions, social services, and welfare organizations are state owned, while all other businesses are privatized, but all primarily follow the market economy alongside a contingency plan managed by the state. The corporate tax rate is a fixed 10.9% plus separate duties or penalties depending on the type of business and how it's structured and managed.

Some primary exports of Shinzen are electronics, cars and trucks, and biotechnology. Shinzen applies import tariffs ranging between 4.7% and 41% depending on the goods, and from where they were imported.

## Demographics

Shinzen has a unique struggle with acceptance of [[Spirits|spirits]], as their official stance is a welcoming one and most people in the country are openly accepting and supportive of spirits, but systemic discrimination still remains, particularly in education and career opportunities. Nevertheless, many spirits are quite happy with their treatment in Shinzen, even though they have fewer opportunities.

Spirit population as of the 2030 census: 14,158,605
- Cat: 8,312,945
- Wolf: 121,004
- Mouse: 243,211
- Deer: 4,298,433
- Chameleon: 550,753
- Shark: 73,231
- Crow: 9,199
- Fox: 13,423
- Others: 536,406

It is suspected that there are many more spirits than this in the country, but it is impossible to verify. Many spirits are known to hide their identity on paper, hide it completely from everyone, or go so far as to live off the grid out of either fear or preference.

### Education

Education in Shinzen is provided primarily by public schools, but private schools are a popular choice among richer families. Education is compulsory under federal law at elementary (1st-6th grade) and lower secondary (7th-9th grade) levels, but the vast majority of students still pursue upper secondary (10th-12th grade) education. Many schools offer two or more levels of education in the same building, but some still offer only one. Public education is tuition-free, and any required educational materials and appropriate clothing or uniforms is provided free of charge, but students whose families are above a certain income level are required to either purchase or supply their own lunches.

Education standards are set nationwide by the Ministry of Education, which encourages achievement and success in education through the use of semi-competitive testing, displaying the test scores of students in the main halls of schools twice annually. Test scores are the primary qualification required to enter public post-secondary education, which most students choose to attempt. Many students also choose to enroll in private cram schools to prepare for university entrance exams.

In anonymous independent surveys of students, over 70% of students say that they feel the workload of the current education system is extremely stressful and harmful to their mental health, and that they feel they have to deal with the stress silently to avoid reprimand.

The Shinzenese educational system produces excellent results, with 4th, 8th, and 12th grade students consistently being ranked 3rd in international test score surveys.

### Health

Healthcare in Shinzen is a hybrid of public and private systems, with many hospitals and pharmacies being run as for-profit businesses, and a universal health insurance program provided to all citizens by the federal government, as well as the option of purchasing supplemental private insurance through an employer or from a local government. Patients are responsible for up to 30% of their medical expenses, with extensive financial assistance options available for poor patients.

The overall health of Shinzenese citizens is excellent.
