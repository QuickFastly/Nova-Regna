Ustonia, officially known as the Federated States of Ustonia, or more commonly the FSU, is an expansive country and international superpower located on the continent of [[Yulentia]], encompassing its entire western half. Its capital, [[Northfair]], is located near the west coast in the northwestern state of [[Arkbay]]. It is bordered by [[Destrea]] to the east and [[Osun Tanum]] to the north, also closely neighbored by [[Alastor]] to the northeast.
%% Northfair coordinates: La. 5°58' Lo. -2°3' (?) %%

Ustonia is a highly developed country with the world's largest population, a thriving semi-industrial economy, and an incredibly well-outfitted military thought to be elite in all aspects. Ustonia is also considered one of the world leaders in engineering, as well as military development, production, and training, and enjoys sweeping success in exporting these goods and services in particular.

Ustonia held aggressive expansionist ideologies for a time and annexed many territories, most notably including a significant portion of Osun Tanum. Many wars were caused as a direct result of Ustonia's aggressive nature, eventually leading the people to grow weary and adopt a much more peaceful ideology through the [[Mistletoe Revolution]] of 1972, rescinding most of their annexations in the process. The only annexed areas from this time that have not been rescinded are [[Isla Sofia]], [[West Vastdal]], and [[South Macdon]].

## History

Ustonia is the second youngest new nation in the world, being less than 400 years old as we know it, even before its formation. The overwhelming majority of the Ustonian population today is of Exilan descent, but the entire continent of Yulentia was populated almost exclusively by the Cirazan peoples prior to the settling of three colonies from nations in [[Ozen]]; With the assistance of the people of [[Torstrøm]] to navigate the sea, the colony of [[Roxware]] was settled by people of [[Manden]], the colony of [[Centralia]] was settled by people of [[Hartmond]], and the colony of [[Gravenwood]] was settled by people of [[Osterfeld]]. The people of Torstrøm spoke only in their native language for all three of the long voyages - from planning to landfall - despite the vital importance of effective communication with the crew and settlers, which led to the [[Exilan]] settlers adoption of their language.

In 1973, the states of [[Prestona]] and [[Verace]] defected from Destrea and declared to the world that they would become part of Ustonia instead. Ustonia, while they did not know of this in advance, shocked the world by immediately annexing the states in response and stationing an overwhelming military force along their borders to deter Destrean aggression. This action is still a subject of heated debate around the world, and was even used by Destrea to justify the [[Reclamation War]], but is generally believed to have been an acceptable action.

## Geography

Ustonia, due to its size, contains highly varied topography, but is largely quite flat. In the southern heartlands of the country is a large desert, surrounded by a tropical savanna with forests along the coast. Further north is a large grassland, followed by temperate forests in the northwest of the country. Ustonia also controls the remote tropical island of Isla Sofia, home to a uniquely thriving rainforest.

## Government & Politics

Ustonia is a democratic federal republic, spearheaded by an executive branch led by an elected president and vice president, and supported by a cabinet of advisors, alongside congress in the legislative branch and the supreme court in the judicial branch. Every branch of the government is subdivided into several smaller, increasingly specific departments, and struggles with a lot of bureaucratic inefficiencies and miscommunications as a result.

### Administrative divisions

The country is divided into 19 states, each with their own state government overseen by an elected governor with some degree of autonomy under the federal government, most with their own unique cultural views that influence their legislation. These states are as follows.
- [[Aldbell]]
- [[Alraine]]
- [[Arkbay]]
- [[Buxwin]]
- [[Corburn]]
- [[Exford]]
- [[Isla Sofia]]
- [[Lonfolk]]
- [[Morwick]]
- [[Norston]]
- [[Orness]]
- [[Oxbalt]]
- [[Prestona]]
- [[South Macdon]]
- [[Stonesea]]
- [[Talles]]
- [[Venfair]]
- [[Verace]]
- [[West Vastdal]]

### Military

The Ustonian military is divided into six primary branches, being the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Air Force, and Star Corps. While Destrea maintains a larger standing army, Ustonia prides itself on being better trained and better equipped while still remaining competitive on sheer size.

### Foreign relations

## Economy

The Ustonian economy is worth 1.98 quadrillion [[Credit (currency)|CR]] per year with an expenditure of 17.3%, which is distributed as follows.
- Administration: 12.5%
- Defense: 30.1%
- Education & Science: 6.3%
- Energy & Environment: 1%
- Food & Agriculture: 2.2%
- Healthcare: 5.2%
- Industry: 9.4%
- International Affairs: 5.2%
- Law & Order: 8.3%
- Social Policy: 5.2%
- Transportation: 11.2%
- Welfare: 3.4%

The average income tax rate is 14.5%, spread across seven tax brackets, ranging from 10% for the lowest income to 37% for the highest income taxpayers. There is no federal sales tax, but some states within the country choose to apply their own sales taxes, ranging from 4.5% to 9.85% where present. The gap between the poorest and the richest citizens is immense, but the overwhelming majority of citizens are working class.

Certain essential services such as welfare workers and public education are split between federal and state ownership, but the overwhelming majority of businesses in Ustonia are privatized and follow the market economy. Corporate and business regulations and taxes are very low, encouraging many foreign businesses to incorporate in Ustonia, and many citizens to attempt entrepreneurship, which has led to widespread hustle culture and a deeply rooted gig economy.

Some primary exports of Ustonia are military equipment and training, plastics, and snack foods. Ustonia applies import tariffs ranging between 0.85% and 31% depending on the goods, and from where they were imported, on top of the standard Yulentian Trade Union tariff of 1% on luxuries from within the union, and 4% outside of it.

## Demographics

The official stance the Ustonian government holds on [[Spirits|spirits]] is one of welcoming and acceptance, but in practice things don't quite match up. While spirits aren't legally oppressed in Ustonia, they still face serious systemic and societal discrimination in day to day life, and often have to work several times as hard as most humans to maintain a positive reputation, good grades, career standing, and so on.

Spirit population as of the 2030 census: 8,574,200
- Cat: 4,734,192
- Wolf: 765,394
- Mouse: 611,967
- Deer: 454,265
- Chameleon: 343,105
- Shark: 196,324
- Crow: 4,021
- Fox: 1,002
- Others: 1,463,930

It is suspected that there are many more spirits than this in the country, but it is impossible to verify. Many spirits are known to hide their identity on paper, hide it completely from everyone, or go so far as to live off the grid out of either fear or preference.

### Education

Education in Ustonia is provided in public and private schools and by individuals through homeschooling, typically starting with kindergarten for kids between 5 and 6 years of age, followed by 1st to 12th grades for kids between 6 and 18 years of age, divided into three levels, being elementary, middle, and high school, which are each typically offered in separate schools. Patriotism is encouraged in most curriculums through the practice of pledging allegiance to the Ustonian flag, spending a disproportionate amount of time studying a curated version of Ustonian history, and annual demonstrations and/or recruitment drives from the national military.

State governments set their own education standards, and the federal government mandates standardized tests for K-12 public school systems. While public schools are tuition-free, students and their families are still responsible for the costs of their own educational materials, lunches, all costs associated with elective courses, and appropriate clothing or uniforms. Post-secondary education in Ustonia is prohibitively expensive for most Ustonians, and is among the largest sources of debt throughout the population.

Education is compulsory under federal law, but neither the federal government nor state governments offer alternatives to poor families who cannot afford the necessary items or food. Many poor families who turn to homeschooling find it to be extremely stressful, as homeschooled students are subject to additional testing, up to four times as frequently as otherwise, and are often also subject to home inspections, especially if the family has a spirit in the household.

The Ustonian educational system produces below average and continuously declining results, with 4th, 8th, and 12th grade students recently falling to the rank of 7th in international test score surveys, overtaken by Shaohou.

### Health

Healthcare in Ustonia is entirely privatized, with hospitals and pharmacies usually being run as for-profit businesses. Citizens are required under federal law to purchase health insurance, which is also a for-profit industry in Ustonia that still leaves many citizens open to large medical bills. For citizens federally classified as living in poverty, state funded insurance plans are provided by local governments at reduced rates, but typically offer limited care. Mental health care is extremely underfunded and rarely covered by insurance, causing most citizens to be forced to wait months to get the help they need, or simply never attempt to get it at all. Equality of access is not mandated by law, and patients can be denied care for a multitude of reasons.

Due to the largely unregulated for-profit structure of the medical and insurance industries in Ustonia, prices for care and pharmaceuticals are grossly inflated up to 2500% higher than what has been deemed fair internationally, causing medical expenses to be the largest source of debt throughout the Ustonian population.

The overall health of Ustonian citizens is below average, notably displaying the highest obesity rate in the world.
