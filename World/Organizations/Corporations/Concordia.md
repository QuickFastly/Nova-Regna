## History

Concordia, or at least the base company itself, was established on April 26th, 1978 by Robert Brunton, his wife Arlette Brunton, Geraldine (Lastname) and Sigmun Hustad after Robert came up with a solution to providing constant, reliable energy to his parent's farm using a more efficient steam boiling and dispersion method, that he then patented and developed under the company name. The process was dependent on an little-understood material named Bosmite, an allotrope of Bismuth infused with mystic matter that allows adjoining fluids, such as air and water, to have higher heat capacities. After applying this discovery to a standard boiler heating system Robert realized he could use this to create a "cold steam" system that allowed for room temperature water vapor to be spread in mass quantities, improving irrigation systems wholesale. 

The innovation alone generated millions in revenue allowing its founders to establish the farm and the surrounding area as an outdoor research facility. As the studying of Bosmite and mystic matter opened more doors of research and technologies, Concordia continued to further use its overwhelming gross income to vastly expanding its land and available facilities to the point where the lot itself became so large it was more efficient to develop housing, recreation, transportation, and other infrastructure on its campus, turning the once small family run farm into a modern urban bubble. 

In 2015 Robert passed away after a slow and steady decline in health over the past few years. As such, Arlette momentarily rose to the position of CEO before being nominated and elected as Minister of Energy. Since then one of her daughters, Lynn Alden, as taken the position in her stead. 

## Public agenda

Company Motto: Lighting the Way Forward
Concordia, above all else, is a research firm devoted to innovating energy production, transmission, and usage. To this end the company devotes it funding to its many energy firms and agricultural businesses, providing education and training for its citizens, along with other resources needed to reach its goal.

## Buildings, facilities, and infrastructure

Concordia is best thought of as a city built around a business, as 73% of its employees live within the complex in individual homes, apartments, and other dwellings. The border of the city-complex is marked by its 500m thick, 40km diameter outer stone/concrete walls. The walls are designed to act as a defensive barrier from outside forces, most notably any artillery fire in the event of an invasion, as the walls were erected during the (Insert Conflict Here) to encapsulate the city in the event war reached Corstaea's shores. The wall structure itself is tiered vertically, as the top levels of the wall are used for pedestrian walking, biking, etc. whereas the lower levels are used for vehicular, locomotive, and maglev transportation of workers, businessmen, materials, and freight throughout the complex's many buildings and levels. Concordia extends roughly 2km below the surface, but consists of mostly maintenance tunnels to move about buildings, pipes and other infrastructure for water, sewage, and electricity, subway tunnels for freight, and the core campuses restricted labs. 

The complex itself takes the shape of its emblem and flag, with the main research facility and executive offices residing in the center circle and below it, with roads and other transportation lines extending to other "villages". Each village has its own smaller theme to it, in terms of climate and vegetation. Villages contain housing units, shops, and clinics. The inner circle houses all of Concordia's business and industry. Energy production and other more demanding tasks are conducted and housed in the underground structure beneath the surface.
