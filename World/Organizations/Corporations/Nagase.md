car, aircraft, and spacecraft company based in [[Shinzen]]. the company is completely fictional with all of its designs created by me, not based on a real company.

Notable car models: Lanza, Aquila, Paloma, Phoenix, Estela, Starcaster, Lovelace, Ridgeback\
Notable aircraft: Dealer, Decorator, Dancer, Debonair, Dawnbreaker, Duskwalker, Deadlock, Dauntless\
Notable spacecraft programs: Outlander, Strider, Tomoe

Notable aircraft:

These aircraft are all particularly notable because of their development. It wasn't known to anyone until it was too late that Destrean spies were heavily involved with Nagase during this time. After they were discovered, the prototypes of all but the Dauntless were stolen by Destrea. Several of these craft were astonishingly superior to anything else in the sky, so news of this happening led to an international state of emergency. Ustonia deployed a massive force to intercept, but were completely wiped out in the battle while the Destreans came out completely unscathed. Aside from the Dauntless, all of these aircraft were given codenames by Ustonia after that battle.

Dealer (XS-63, S-63)

The Dealer is a somewhat unassuming looking twin engine interceptor and precision bomber aircraft with a top speed of mach 3.6 and a cruising speed of mach 3.0 at 20km altitude, a service ceiling of 22km, and average maneuverability. Its namesake comes from its primary armaments, which are its devastating air-to-ground missiles that never missed a target during its first battle with Ustonia, and its high volume short-range omnidirectional air-to-air missiles. It entered production in 1989 and remains in service in Shinzen and Osun Tanum.

Decorator (XS-64, S/B-64)

The Decorator is a large and imposing looking twin engine fighter-bomber with a top speed of mach 1.7 and a cruising speed of mach 1.2 at 8km altitude, a service ceiling of 18km, and above average maneuverability. Its namesake comes from its overwhelmingly numerous omnidirectional MIRV missiles, capable of tracking both air and ground targets. It entered production in 1986 and remains in service in Shinzen and Ustonia, though the production version is only capable of half as many simultaneous targets as the prototype.

Dancer (XS-61, S-61D)

The Dancer is a very small, sleek, lightweight single engine air superiority fighter with a top speed of mach 2.2 and a cruising speed of mach 1.6 at 8km altitude, a service ceiling of 15km, and extreme maneuverability. Its namesake comes from its maneuverability, as it appeared to dance through the skies effortlessly during the battle with Ustonia, capable of outmatching four fighters at the same time. It carries a small amount of simple air-to-air missiles, no flares, and rather than a large caliber cannon, uses four medium caliber machine guns. Unlike all the other planes from this period, there were two prototypes made. It entered production in 1990 but was quickly retired after only four were built due to the extreme skill required to pilot effectively, as the numerous assistive technologies and advanced life support systems were not carried over from the prototypes due to cost. All four Dancers produced were disarmed and now tour the world as an air show demonstrator group.

Debonair (XS-62, S-62E)

The Debonair is the bigger brother of the Dancer, looking very much like a larger, longer version of it. It is a lightweight single engine electronic warfare fighter with a top speed of mach 2.5 and a cruising speed of mach 1.9 at 12km altitude, a service ceiling of 20km, and high maneuverability. Its namesake comes mostly from its appearance, and because it was never far from the Dancer during the battle with Ustonia. It is assumed it was conducting both electronic support for the Dancer and jamming everyone else. It carries a large amount of air-to-air missiles, flares, four unarmed jamming/surveillance drones, and a single large caliber cannon. It entered production in 1990 without its drones, and was reconfigured immediately after the retiring of the Dancers to increase its offensive effectiveness. It remains in service in Shinzen.

Dawnbreaker and Duskwalker (XS-65A and XS-65B)

These twin craft are midsize, twin engine air superiority fighters with a top speed of mach 2.8 and a cruising speed of mach 2.0 at 8km altitude, a service ceiling of 41km, and very high maneuverability. Their namesakes aren't explained, so they probably came from raw fear and awe, coming from the fact that they look like nothing else in the sky and are armed like nothing else as well. Both craft are equipped with gauss guns rather than traditional cannons. Dawnbreaker is also equipped with a devastating retractable railgun and high speed air-to-air missiles, and Duskwalker with a retractable laser beam cannon and onboard missile jammers. They were never put into production.

Deadlock (X-1)

The Deadlock is the culmination of all the previous craft, a large, imposing, alien looking, triple engine (twin turbojet, single ramjet) all purpose fighter with a top speed of mach 5.1 and a cruising speed of mach 2.8 at 8km altitude, a service ceiling of 96km, and maneuverability that nearly defies the laws of physics. This craft was never seen during the battle with Ustonia, and it is only known to exist because Nagase informed the world as such, and it was named before the battle started as Ustonia assumed it would give their fighters a roughly equal match. After seeing the devastation brought about by the other craft, they fear the Deadlock more than anything. It is equipped with twin gauss cannons, a retractable railgun and laser beam cannon, high speed air-to-air missiles, omnidirectional multipurpose MIRV missiles, an automatic rear mounted CIWS, and is nuclear capable. Production was never planned.

Dauntless (X-0)

The Dauntless was meant to be a smaller, faster, more maneuverable craft than the Deadlock, but with equal firepower. However, it was stolen during development by a daring rookie test pilot, and was far from being finished. The airframe was complete, but it was still running a test engine at the time and was only equipped with basic guns and missiles. This plane being stolen is what directly led to the discovery of Destrean spies within Nagase and kicked off the whole incident. Rather than running three engines, it runs a single engine, designed to be able to toggle between turbojet and ramjet mode in flight, but the test engine lacked that ability. The plane and its daring pilot were taken by the Risky Witches before Shinzen or Destrea could get their hands on them. All that's known about the Dauntless are what it's designed to be theoretically capable of, but since its loss, its fate is unknown.

Spacecraft programs:

Outlander

The Outlander program is the world's first successful deep space exploration program, with the ultimate goal of developing manned interstellar travel. Outlander 1, launched in 1983, was lost 11 months and 13 days into its mission, cause unknown as the craft seemed to have completely disappeared and was no longer visible from any telescopes. Outlander 2, launched in 1985, officially entered interstellar space exactly 30 years into its mission and is still in operation.

Strider

The Strider program is Nagase's contribution to the [[Global Space Platform]] project, being a dedicated personnel shuttle. It is a single stage to orbit craft with a capacity of 2 crew and 5 passengers, capable of both taking off and landing on an ordinary aircraft runway. Strider 1 was launched in 1998 at full capacity to fill the newly completed space station. It has since completed 34 more round trips and is still considered to be in service. Strider 2 was launched in 1999, but was tragically lost during landing due to an engine malfunction, killing all passengers. Strider 3 was launched in 2006, but aborted mission before exiting the atmosphere due to electrical malfunctions. The pilot shut down all non-critical electrical systems and safely landed the craft unassisted. It was studied extensively after that incident and now resides in an aerospace museum. Strider 4 was completed in 2008 but was immediately decommissioned after discovering a critical design flaw traced back to Strider 2. Strider 5 was launched in 2012 with no issues, has completed 21 round trips, and is still in service.

Tomoe

The Tomoe program was originally intended to replace the Strider program, but instead works hand-in-hand as its sister craft. Its name comes from Tomoe Harada, the late pilot of Strider 2. Smaller and sleeker, yet more powerful than the Strider craft, the Tomoe craft carries cargo rather than passengers, and is equipped with retractable articulating arms ranging for moving large objects or conducting repairs. Capable of reaching the space station in just over two thirds the time required for Strider to do so, Tomoe is also used for emergency transport. Tomoe 1 was launched in 2004 with no issues and completed 11 round trips before being decommissioned, and it now resides in an aerospace museum. Tomoe 2 was launched in 2005 with no issues and completed three round trips before being replaced by Tomoe 3. However, it was then modified to shed as much weight as possible and converted to an ambulance of sorts, has completed two emergency flights since then, and remains on standby. Tomoe 3 was completed in 2009 with no issues, has completed seven round trips, and is still in service.
