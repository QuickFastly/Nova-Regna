[[Kitabe Proving Grounds]]

A racing team founded by [[Haruna Kitami]], [[Ryoko Kijima]], and [[Reina Morita]] shortly after they met. The name was chosen by Haruna to symbolize her goal of exceeding the expectations of everyone. They recruit new members by making bets with unaffiliated racers, making them join the team if they lose the race. Unlike most other teams on the road, Exceed doesn't have strict rules about what to drive or how the cars must look, and they don't take any cut of the winnings from the team members.Â 

When Haruna later began to learn of the corruption controlling the streets, she made it her goal to take down the perpetrators and restore the old order to the streets, and made the team even more unique to facilitate this. Exceed began to "ally" itself with other racing teams. By challenging other teams to races and defeating every member, their team becomes a part of Exceed as well while being allowed to keep their own name.
