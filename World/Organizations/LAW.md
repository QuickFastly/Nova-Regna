The racing team that officially took over [[Run Free Race Team]]. Nobody knows who founded this team, but many members of Run Free are still racing as part of LAW. They are known for setting very high wagers and winning races at all costs. Those who defeat a LAW member, refuse to race, or refuse to join when asked, are often arrested and found in news headlines mere days later. 

Ultimately, [[Haruna Kitami]] learns that LAW is actually run by local corrupt government officials and police officers. They blackmailed the major Run Free members into either joining them or losing everything. All the other members were ignored under the condition that Run Free be disbanded. 

The arrangement is that the racers are forced to win high wagers and allow the "management" to collect the funds, and to provide information to law enforcement when they don't cooperate. The blackmail runs very deep, as the people in control of LAW have the ability to seize the racers property, blacklist them from much of the job market, and charge them with so many crimes it would bankrupt them and leave them facing life in prison with little to no chance of parole.
