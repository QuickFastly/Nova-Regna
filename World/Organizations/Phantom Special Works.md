The legendary tuning shop owned and run by [[Masashi Kitami]], and the source of his nickname. The shop quickly built its reputation by building cars that weren't just powerful, nor just smooth and reliable, but for building cars that excel in every area with seemingly no drawbacks. It cost a lot of money to get a PSW built vehicle, but not a single customer was ever disappointed.
