The Children of the Flame are the world's largest religious organization, and one of only three remaining major hierarchical religious organizations in modern times. It is headquartered in the city of [[Falkenvall]] in [[Kolg√•rd]], [[Osun Tanum]].

They are presumed to be the oldest known religious organization of all time, as there is no record of their formation, yet they have always possessed and been recorded in some of the oldest documents known to man.

## Structure

The Children of the Flame is divided into four unique branches, each performing a distinct function with their own positions and power structures. Only two of these branches - the [[Law and Lore]] and [[Preachers]] branches - are publicly acknowledged, with the other two - the [[Enforcers]] and [[Internal Society]] branches - shrouded in secrecy and only known due to undercover investigations and leaks.

## Public Agenda

Under the reign of [[The Sixth Storyteller]], the primary public goals of the organization have been humanitarian and charitable efforts, cultural development, and scientific research. They are lauded worldwide for their efforts in these fields, particularly for being almost single-handedly responsible for multiple disaster relief efforts, the largest donators for multiple charities, credited for many culturally significant works, and being instrumental in the discovery of [[Mystic Matter]].

==There have been many cases of people seeking legal action against the organization, many claiming that the Children of the Flame was responsible for a murder or worse. Most organizations would be permanently damaged by such allegations, but the Children of the Flame is unique for its ability to twist such things to their favor by quickly and publicly acknowledging what was done, punishing those responsible, and doing everything in their power to help the affected individuals.== These strong public relations efforts are a large contributing factor to their rapidly increasing followers around the world.

## Assets

==They hold a modest library of ancient texts, believed to be prophecies, stories, commandments, and other divine writings from their gods. Today they have been treated primarily as historical artifacts rather than sources of guidance.== These artifacts are proudly displayed in their major gathering places, and digitized copies are made available to the public upon request.

## History

While the specific origins of the Children of the Flame have been lost to time, it is believed that they have existed since the transition to Anno Ortu from [[Era Dira]]. Allegedly, they formed after seeing their gods help to rebuild in the aftermath of a global disaster, and their worship slowly strengthened after their gods disappeared and more emphasis was instead placed on the ancient texts they had collected. Their faith was global, but disorganized ==until they formally organized themselves, established a hierarchy and appointed a leader - called a Storyteller - somewhere around the year 1160.== Each Storyteller steered the organization in radically different directions.

During the reign of the First Storyteller, the organization was focused firmly on the peace and prosperity of human society. Despite good intentions, their teachings led to a spike in racism against [[Spirits|spirits]]. This reign lasted about 100 years.

The Second Storyteller was someone who took the racism of the previous reign to heart, and shifted the focus of the organization to domination. Many atrocities were committed during this time, ==including one large scale crusade against another religious organization.== This reign lasted about 60 years.

The Third Storyteller loosened the iron grip of the Second, and shifted the organization towards hedonism. ==Atrocities did not stop entirely, however, and the organization was still under fire for its extremely poor reputation.== This reign lasted about 90 years.

The Fourth Storyteller idolized stories of the reign of the Second and turned the organization back towards violence, this time not only craving dominance, but absolute supremacy. The entire reign became one global crusade infamous for some of the worst atrocities in known history, including mass rape and genocide of spirits. This reign lasted about 40 years.

The Fifth Storyteller was disgusted by the Fourth, and began their reign by taking the head of the Fourth and executing all those who took part in the atrocities. The organization was withdrawn from the public eye during this reign, only showing themselves in attempts to right their wrongs and improve their reputation. This laid the groundwork for their most dramatic shift yet. This reign lasted about 110 years.

==The Sixth Storyteller successfully brought the organization back into the public eye as both a beacon of light and a force of nature. While certain groups within the organization were still highly questionable at best, he took the spotlight off of them and kept the organization's best side visible at all times. He changed the organization from a stifling religion to a champion of the people. Membership skyrocketed, and for the first time in their history, public opinion of the organization was positive. The ancient texts that directed the actions of all previous Storytellers were relegated to the libraries as artifacts, and instead the Sixth Storyteller would commune directly with their gods for guidance, even moving them into the public eye.==

## Mythology

The Children of the Flame worship three deities, being the immortal [[Incarnations]] [[Florian]], [[Freya]], and [[Kerosyn]].

==Despite possessing an extensive collection of ancient stories, three in particular stand out. These stories are not recorded among the ancient texts, but were instead recorded by the organization themselves during their origins, and even spread into both secular history as well as the history of other religions.==

==As a result of this, these stories were malformed, mistranslated and misinterpreted throughout history with some passages even being outright lost. However, early on in the reign of the Sixth Storyteller, the stories were reconstructed. All versions have been kept for posterity, sometimes leading to confusion among those who don't know any better, but most Listeners and even secular people choose to believe the Storyteller's account to be the truth.==

### The Beginning

This story describes the process of the world's creation. It spawned countless variations and interpretations throughout history, but every single variation shares at least one commonality: They all depict "The Creator" as a beautiful woman who sacrificed herself for humanity. Some interpretations claim she did it to save humans from destruction, others believe it was an attempt to eradicate them, and countless interpretations exist between those two extremes.

%%The story isn't actually written yet, and doesn't really need to be.%%

### The Reckoning

This is the story recounting the great wars of humanity before the end of everything. All interpretations contain the statement that human population dropped to near extinction, but each version of the story has its own idea of the cause. Some say it's because humans invoked the wrath of the gods, others say it was hubris or arrogance, a petty conflict that got out of hand, among many other causes. Many stories have mentioned a god by name, but these names were never corroborated by other variations. The one exception to that observation is [[Morrigan]], who appears as a common name in many variations of the story, contributing to the feared reputation of the [[Crow|crows]].

%%The story isn't actually written yet, and doesn't really need to be.%%

### The Inferno

This story is the most consistent across multiple versions. It describes an event known by most as [[The End of Everything]], and Armageddon to some. A common theme found in all versions of this story is that the world was bathed in fire with only a minuscule fraction of life remaining to rebuild. This is the event dividing Era Dira and Anno Ortu on the calendar. The most notorious variation of this story was entirely fabrication, introduced by a power-hungry High Cardinal before The Sixth Storyteller had a chance to publicize his account, and was preserved to be used as an example. It is as follows:

*And in the end times, the false one bore control of the world and was to marshal it to ruination, yet the destroyer stood up to the false one and engaged him in war. They fought for a thousand years bringing perpetual wink and woe to all those around them, till one day appeared the deceiver, whom tricked them into believing neither one was content to battle any longer, and mocked the men into worshiping her as the one righteous god for a thousand years. And in the two thousandth year, the deliverer stood up and denounced those men for their sins, and he demonstrated his righteousness by taking the heart of the false one and burning him towards the pyre, from which the flames spread across all of the of the world, and the destroyer known his righteous bid and was sent to amerce those men of sin, while those men whom saw the righteousness of the deliverer and pledged themselves to him were spared, among them, the deceiver prostrated herself and declared herself to be reformed. And towards the day of the solar eclipse, the deliverer granted a righteous speech to those men whom pledged to him, and bestowed upon them the code to live by, lest the destroyer amerce their sins, and then he rose up and the entirety of the world was bathed in his holy flame, born anew from the ashes, our home.*

### The Sixth Storyteller's Account

A story in itself, [[The Account|this account]] was written by The Sixth Storyteller after a private meeting with the three deities of the organization. In this account, details of all three previous stories are covered and rectified, along with new information not previously known, though it is more of a life story of the deities than an informative report. It was kept secret for a number of years following the spread of the fabricated story of The Inferno and was even tampered with, presumably by the power-hungry High Cardinal. The original tampered documents are preserved in the library for posterity, but the restored original version is widely available.

## Tenets

One is expected to adhere to the six virtues at all times unless given no choice, or when possessing an infallible reason to go against them.

1. One is expected to practice Wisdom. Remain curious, creative, and open minded, so that you may shine brightly and flourish.
1. One is expected to practice Courage. Hold fast in times of hardship, and do not falter when your integrity is challenged.
1. One is expected to practice Justice. If none stand up first, take charge and lead them fairly, so they may repent for their sins.
1. One is expected to practice Humanity. A fair life does not end with fairness, but with love, kindness, and awareness.
1. One is expected to practice Temperance. Seek calmness, remain humble, and show mercy to those who have wronged you.
1. One is expected to strive for Transcendence. Always remain hopeful, express deserved gratitude, and become a beacon of light.

## Ethics

Members of the Children of the Flame are expected to live peaceful and positive lives, to be good influences on those around them, and to be selfless, as the tenets dictate. Of course, there are many exceptions to this rule, most obviously being the Enforcers and the Internal Society operating on their own sets of rules.

The code of ethics for the Enforcers is, by all definitions, heretical. They embody the sins of the masses, and are not held to the tenets as a result. ==Despite their twisted and evil ways, they remain dedicated to their faith and fully realize that they are heretical, leading their wing of the organization to remain in the shadows, even to the organization itself, and their primary guiding light to be simply following orders to the letter.==

==The Internal Society tries to walk the tightrope between virtue and sin, with their members being expected to adhere to the tenets at all times not "at work." Be it simple manipulation or anything more sinister, or even simple personal indulgence, they are allowed to largely ignore the tenets for that time. However, their cardinal rule that they also enforce on all other wings of the organization, is that Sisters must be treated with fairness, care and kindness no matter what the circumstances may be unless they themselves agree to indoctrination, and to be allowed to live as happily as possible.==

## Worship

Generally, displays of worship are not expected among members of the organization except during special occasions, such as the performing of a sacramental rite[^1]. All members of the organization are treated as faithful worshipers so long as they remain without sin, or repent promptly. Because of this lax nature, even secular individuals can often be found living in line with the expectations of the organization. Even in the presence of the deities themselves, people are not expected to stifle themselves.

A common prayer among the organization is a glorification of the three deities. Some scholars believe it was once a specialized prayer among dozens of others, but today it is used only for traditional purposes and is the only prayer still persistent in the organization. 

> *Quod liberatio, perditionem devorans, et Deceptio, gloriam nomini tuo. Sicut in principio, et nunc et in perpetuum. Amen.*

## Political influence

Testament to the cunning nature of The Sixth Storyteller, the organization has leveraged its stellar public opinion to stealthily insert itself into not only the political organizations of the world, but nearly everything else. Save for a remarkable few exceptions such as [[11K]] and the [[Risky Witches]], the Children of the Flame hold the world in the palm of their hand, quietly pulling strings in the background. Each of the aforementioned organizations are equally as powerful, however, leading the three of them to be in a constant power struggle behind the scenes of the international stage.

[^1]: Each branch of the organization has their own sacramental rites, which are described in their respective articles.
