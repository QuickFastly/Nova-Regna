The Enforcers branch of the [[Children of the Flame]] is a quite small but very powerful force of militaristic people, responsible for all the dirty work of the organization. They operate from the shadows for the most part, killing their targets quietly, simply gathering intelligence, or manipulating people for their own ends, though occasionally they will make large, organized, very public attacks when ordered.

## Structure

### Inquisitors

These are the people responsible for identifying and dealing with heretics and any others marked by the higher-ups of the organization. They are most known for their use of gruesome torture methods and seeming to take pleasure in carrying them out, but are most commonly sent out purely for espionage. Notably, no Inquisitors possess [[Attunement|attunement]]. Becoming an Inquisitor requires a test to prove oneself dedicated. This test is decided on a case by case basis and must be carried out alone.

### The Sanctified

These people are basically a more merciful version of the Inquisitors, and much more focused on the divine aspect of their work. Where the Inquisitors derive pleasure or entertainment in their tasks, The Sanctified are disgusted by the barbaric nature. They take great pride as divine and merciful executioners. Notably, all of The Sanctified possess attunement.

There are an extremely small number of The Sanctified due both to the rarity of attunement and the difficulty of the training required.

### The Infernal

Basically just a mix of the above, but lower class. They are essentially the front line infantry of the Enforcers, almost never being trusted with important tasks and most often being utilized in great numbers. They are selected by Inquisitors or the Sanctified based on ability and desire.

## Sacramental rites

### Banishment

This rite is performed by an Inquisitor. The recipient is tortured until their mind is broken, and then the Inquisitor violently grabs hold of their face and delivers a scathing reprimand, finalized by throwing the recipient into the nearest hard surface or by submerging their head in water. Those who survive this horrific procedure are usually left in a vegetative state for the remainder of their lives, and those few who manage to recover or resist are marked for death.

### Forgiveness

This rite is performed by one of the Sanctified, as a much more merciful version of the rite of Banishment. The recipient is restrained, their crimes explained, a sacred text read to them, and finalized with a swift decapitation. Notably, they will always give the recipient a proper burial and even inform and console the next of kin if they're alive and not themselves guilty.

### Purification

This rite is performed by either an Inquisitor or one of the Sanctified, and is reserved for the truly heinous heretics. The recipient is restrained and stretched on a rack, sacred texts are fervently read, then the recipient is cut open with a Y-shaped incision and immolated from the inside out.
