The Internal Society of the [[Children of the Flame]] shares very little with the other branches, instead operating much like a dynastic harem. They stay even further out of the public eye than the [[Enforcers]] branch due to their immoral, unethical, and illegal activity.

The continued presence of this part of the organization is a point of extreme contention among those who are aware of it, as nobody outside of the Internal Society believes it should be allowed to exist, nor do they understand how it persists. The true amount of influence the Internal Society holds over the organization is still unknown.

## Structure

### Matriarchs

These elite women are basically super Sirens. Everything a Siren can do, a Matriarch can do better. However, they remain sequestered in the Internal Society to manage things, instead targeting Patriarchs and Initiates with their various techniques. They evaluate prospective Initiates alongside the Patriarchs. Occasionally, they will take a Patriarch as a husband, though they ultimately hold higher authority than the Patriarchs do. Becoming a Matriarch requires being subject to the rite of Draining and the rite of Breaking one time each, and successfully resisting of all the effects.

### Eunuchs

These are the men who, as Initiates, showed a strong will and resisted all temptation from the Sirens, while also showing enough respect to have made no advances on the Sisters. They are then brought before the Matriarchs and receive the rite of Castration, and from then on dedicate themselves to guarding the Internal Society. They generally develop familial relationships with the women which only strengthens their devotion.

### Sirens

These women are masters of seduction, manipulation and trickery. Of the entire Internal Society, they are the only ones ever seen in public, though they aren't recognized because they have no vestments. They hypnotize - figuratively or literally depending on the person and their abilities - unsuspecting or vulnerable people and manipulate them into doing their bidding, most commonly using their bodies to their advantage.

### Sisters

These are the women who among the Devout display a vested interest in the faith, and are noticed by the Internal Society as promising specimens. They are taken under the wing of the Sirens as little sisters, hence the name, and indoctrinated into the Internal Society. Those who display enough willpower to resist both indoctrination and the advances of the Patriarchs and Initiates are brought before the Matriarchs and tested, where they will either pass and become Sirens or fail and be psychologically abused until they become totally dependent on the Matriarchs.

## Sacramental rites

### Castration

Performed by a Matriarch, the prospective Eunuch is hypnotized and castrated.

### Draining

Performed by Sirens or Matriarchs, this rite utilizes their exceptional abilities of hypnosis and manipulation. Recipients are slowly hypnotized during a sexual encounter and not allowed to orgasm until they are under full control of the performer, where they then use the moment of orgasm to implant an idea or an order in the recipient's mind with impressive efficacy.

The recipient is left extremely exhausted after this but unable to sleep, and they feel hollow and lost for up to a week after the encounter, assuming the performer doesn't repeat the rite immediately. It can be repeated as many times as the performer wants, even to the point of killing the recipient.

### Breaking

Very similar to the rite of Draining, but instead designed purely to humiliate, demoralize, and ultimately break the mind. Some recipients may end up in a vegetative state, others may have a permanent personality change, the effect varies. It can also be repeated to the point of death.
