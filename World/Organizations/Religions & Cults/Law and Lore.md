The Law and Lore branch of the [[Children of the Flame]] is responsible for the administration, bureaucracy, and other official dealings, as well as maintaining order within the organization through management and enforcement of laws, and keeping the lore, prophecies, and other history organized and prevalent in teachings. They are the highest ranking members of the organization with authority over all other branches.

## Structure

### The Storyteller

This is the highest position in the organization. What this person says is absolute, and all decisions can be overruled by them. They have an encyclopedic knowledge of the history of the organization, their texts, and laws.

Traditionally, The Storyteller is meant to wear the most extravagant vestments and be treated like a god, and this was upheld until the Sixth reign where this and nearly every other tradition was broken.

They are informed of every decision and action made by the organization at any point in time, but are rarely involved in the process unless it is a particularly major event, or when intervention is needed. There can be only one Storyteller at any given time, and the position - when available - is selected on merit alone.

### Cardinals 

These are the people responsible for all major decision making and organizing law, sacrament, and other holy activities. They oversee the Enforcers wing alone, and assist the Seekers in overseeing the Preachers wing. They wear extravagant black vestments with tall hats, but the High Cardinal is exempt from this instead wearing what The Storyteller says to wear.

The High Cardinal is assigned directly to The Storyteller as an advisor and to relay information. They are akin to politicians in their role. To become a Cardinal, one must be selected personally by the High Cardinal and then perform the Cardinal's Rite.

### Seekers

These are the people responsible for managing all activities of the Preachers wing, as well as overseeing the Internal Society. They are not concerned with managing the law, instead focusing on keeping the lore and history of the organization, while also acting as the lead scientists of the organization. They wear extravagant white vestments with no hat, but the High Seeker is exempt from this instead wearing what The Storyteller says to wear.

The High Seeker acts as The Storyteller's right hand, and is almost always with him to discuss whatever needs discussing and help with whatever is needed. To become a Seeker, one must prove their merit through a series of tests and then perform the Seeker's Rite.

### Chancellors

The bureaucrats of the organization, these are the people responsible for all administrative tasks and paper pushing. Almost all paperwork that needs to be done by any other member of the organization is usually routed to the Chancellors, and the Chancellors are often the ones delivering official orders. They wear understated vestments that distinguish them from all other classes. Becoming a Chancellor is as simple as filling out a form and turning in a resume.

### Firekeepers

The mystics of the organization, these elite few are [[Attunement]] users with an affinity for flames. These are the people responsible for performing sacraments, meting out internal punishments, and mystifying the people in public demonstrations. They wear light and wavy vestments with open or no footwear, exuding an aura of exotic elegance. Firekeepers are chosen for their powers and asked to perform the Mystic Dance, only allowed to become a Firekeeper if their dance impresses the High Cardinal and High Seeker.

## Sacramental rites

### Mystic Dance

Firekeepers perform a mesmerizing ceremonial dance similar to a ribbon dance, but with flames instead of ribbons. They use no tools, implements, or anything else for the dance.

There are two versions of this dance. One being the public demonstration, where the performance is focused on mystifying viewers with smooth and elegant movements and hypnotizing flames. The other being the private version, where the performance is focused much more on primal or seductive movements and overwhelming flame pillars.

### Seeker's Rite

Prospective seekers are selected to perform this rite. Those who succeed become a Seeker and those who fail are allowed to try again when they heal.

The prospective seeker dons the ceremonial vestment and is brought to two Firekeepers who grab hold of the prospective seeker's forearms and begin to burn them. A Cardinal grabs hold of the prospective seeker's neck, raises them off the ground and begins to read sacred texts. If the prospective seeker remains conscious for the duration of the reading, they are asked if they are ready, and if they agree, the Firekeepers immolate the prospective seeker. If the prospective seeker's will is strong enough, the flames will not burn them and will be extinguished when the Cardinal releases them. Buckets of water and a medical team are kept on standby for the weak willed.

### Cardinal's Rite

Prospective cardinals are selected to perform this rite personally by the High Cardinal. It is a purely ceremonial act, where the High Cardinal douses the prospective cardinal's head in black oil, and then burns the brand onto the back of their dominant hand.

### Cleansing

Those who sin or engage in heresy and repent will be given the choice of undergoing this rite, or either being expelled from the organization or receiving an Enforcer's rite, depending on the severity of their crimes.

During Cleansing, the recipient is doused in water by a Cardinal, then a Firekeeper engulfs the recipient in flame while they prostrate themselves begging for forgiveness. This is repeated six times, and if all goes smoothly, the recipient is pardoned and lauded by everyone.
