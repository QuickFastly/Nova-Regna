The Preachers branch of the [[Children of the Flame]] is not quite what one would expect by the name. Their primary responsibility lies not in spreading the word of their faith, but rather in public relations, leaving the actual preaching to the lowest ranked members. These people are the face of the group, the only part that the vast majority of people know.

## Structure

### Patriarchs

The "fatherly" types of the organization, these are the people that the entire Preachers wing answer to. They wear extravagant vestments and are rarely seen in public except for ceremonial occasions, but those within the organization beneath them tend to look up to the Patriarchs as role models.

Mostly unknown to everyone, however, the Patriarchs also play a part in the [[Internal Society]] of the organization, evaluating Initiates to see whether or not they would fit as Eunuchs and sometimes engaging in debauchery with the Sisters behind closed doors. Patriarchs are appointed personally by the Seekers.

### Reverends

These are the people that the public imagine when they hear about the organization. They all have subtle but distinct vestments allowing them to stand out from the public, and they are all trained to appear as warm, friendly and approachable as possible, making them exude a divine and pleasant aura.

They dedicate much of their time to helping those in need, and are commonly seen assisting with disaster relief, humanitarian fundraising events, and grand openings of public buildings.

Becoming a Reverend is as simple as expressing interest to a Patriarch, who will then look over the things they have done to help the public and decide whether or not the prospective Reverend is worthy. In special cases, they may be selected by a Firekeeper instead.

### Priests

These are the people on the front lines of the public, making every effort to help people in need and sharing their knowledge of the organization to those showing interest. They blend in seamlessly with the public due to wearing no vestments and not being outspoken about the organization. Becoming a Priest is as simple as expressing interest to a Reverend.

### Initiates

These are the men who among the Devout display a vested interest in the faith, and are noticed by the Internal Society as promising specimens. They are taken under the wing of both Patriarchs and Eunuchs and trained in the respective classes, and regularly evaluated to see which side of them shows more promise before eventually becoming either a Patriarch or a Eunuch themselves.

## Sacramental rites

### Blessing of the Flame

This is a ceremonial rite performed by a Reverend or Patriarch. The recipient is asked to kneel in front of them and bow their head, then the Reverend or Patriarch delivers a powerful speech designed to manipulate the minds of those who hear it.

Charisma is vital to successfully perform this rite, as the strength of the blessing is only as strong as the conviction of the Reverend or Patriarch. The effects vary depending on what the recipient thinks, what is being said, and how charismatic the performer is.

### Absolution

People, whether they are Devout or not, who feel as though they have committed sin and feel guilty may speak to a Priest or a Reverend to be forgiven. Like the Blessing of the Flame, the effect of this depends heavily on the charisma of the Priest or Reverend.

### Baptism

Adults who express interest in dedicating themselves to the faith can speak to a Reverend to undergo baptism. The recipient knees and bows their head, then a clear kerosene oil is drizzled over their head. The recipient is then considered one of the Devout.
