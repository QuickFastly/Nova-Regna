The Risky Witches are a paramilitary group led by [[Freya]] and comprised primarily of Destrean separatists, [[Spirits|spirits]], and humans with [[Attunement|attunement]]. They present themselves primarily as a revolutionary group seeking independence, but also offer their services as private military contractors and security professionals. They are headquartered at [[Presidia de la Bruja]] in the [[Espada]] prefecture of [[Destrea]], and also control [[Presidio de Tiburón]] in the [[Nalano]] prefecture.

They are known globally for their extraordinary military strength, rumored to be capable of turning the tides of battle while outnumbered ten to one, and most infamous for executing [[The Big Event]]. They lean heavily into their reputation by choosing to mobilize the smallest force possible for most operations. Because of this, the intimidation factor can be so great when they do rarely mobilize a large force that their enemies may sometimes surrender entirely without a fight.

Because of their strong focus on the protection of spirits and marginalized humans, the Risky Witches emblem is seen as a symbol of hope for many of those people. At the same time, many people loyal to their countries or ignorant of the issues the Risky Witches call attention to see their emblem as a symbol of death and suffering due to the frightening military prowess they flaunt.

## Structure

While the Risky Witches are not affiliated with any political entities, they are structured in largely the same standard fashion as the regular armies of the world with eight Enlisted ranks (E-1 - E-8), and eight Officer ranks (O-1 - O-8), though they have no need to distinguish between commissioned, non-commissioned and warrant officers. Instead, becoming an Officer is accomplished by merit alone, only needing to prove oneself capable and be willing to fill the role.

The rank of O-8, Grand Marshal, is only held by Freya, though there isn't any official record of her. Most members of the Risky Witches only know of her existence and authority through legend or description, and foreign entities are given false information if they inquire.

Since she has the ability to monitor the entire world all at once, she's always informed, but since she's not particularly interested in personally running an entire military herself, she hand picks the Field, Air, and Sea Marshals and distributes information through them. On the rare occasion she personally takes control, it's usually to turn the tide of battle in her favor, as her direct control can increase effective strength to that of a force five times their size, or to the point of being virtually undefeatable with the assistance of [[Haida]].

Freya and Haida are also both members of Task Force 5555 along with [[Garm]], [[Dvalinn]], [[Kuhai]], and [[Neven]]. No official record of any of them - or even their unit - exists, but their existence is nevertheless known to members of the Risky Witches. Aside from Freya, all of them hold the effective rank of O-6.

### Army

The Army branch of the Risky Witches is split into three primary, two secondary, and three special divisions.

The three primary divisions are Infantry, Artillery, and Armor. The Infantry division is comprised entirely of typical foot soldiers, sometimes equipped with light armored personnel carriers. The Artillery division is a combined arms division focused on very heavy weaponry, most often deployed to support other units or to lay siege to fortifications. The Armor division is a combined arms division focused on tank and armored cavalry units, most often deployed for all-out offense.

The two secondary divisions are Aviation and Defense. The Aviation division is comprised entirely of offensive helicopter units, while the Defense division is comprised of a mixture of Infantry, Artillery, Armor, and Aviation units, trained specifically to defend against significantly larger forces.

The three special divisions are Shock, Night, and Combat Search and Rescue. These divisions are all comprised of only the highest performing soldiers from the primary divisions. The Shock division is trained specifically to surprise and overwhelm the enemy with the goal of wiping them out or capturing a target before they can sufficiently react to the attack, while the Night division is essentially the same but trained to carry out their operations optimally at night, and the Combat Search and Rescue division focuses on piercing enemy lines to recover lost or downed allies.

| Unit name | Strength  | Subordinate units              | Officer in command      |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Fire team | 2-4       | ---                            | (O-1) Lieutenant        |
| Squad     | 4-16      | 2-4 Fire teams                 | (O-2) Captain           |
| Company   | 8-128     | 2-8 Squads                     | (O-3) Major             |
| Battalion | 16-768    | 2-6 Companies                  | (O-4) Colonel           |
| Regiment  | 32-3,840  | 2-5 Battalions                 | (O-5) Brigadier General |
| Corps     | ---       | Every regiment in the division | (O-6) General           |
| *Army*    | *~89,400* | The entire army                | (O-7) Field Marshal                        |

In addition to the regular forces, there is an elite combined arms regiment of 1,300 soldiers permanently garrisoned in Presidio de la Bruja as guard, and approximately 1,000 civilians tasked with supplying and maintaining the Army branch.

### Air force

The Air Force branch of the Risky Witches is split into three divisions.

The 1st Division is dedicated entirely to air superiority. It is comprised of 1st Wing "Lanza", focused on maximum offensive power and maneuverability, and 2nd Wing "Javelin", specializing in long range deployments.

The 2nd Division is comprised of 3rd Wing "Chaparrón" and 4th Wing "Silver Wind", both multirole wings focused on short and long range deployments respectively, similar to the 1st Division.

The 3rd Division is comprised of 5th Wing "Pepita", a reserve wing dedicated to training and demonstration operations. It is also home to 49th Wing "Ghost", but the existence of this wing is classified as top secret. 

| Unit name   | Personnel | Aircraft      | Subordinate units    | Officer in command  |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Element     | 5-40      | 2             | ---                  | (O-1) Pilot Officer |
| Unit        | 10-160    | 4-8 (Crew 3+) | 2-4 Elements         | (O-2) Lieutenant    |
| Flight      | 10-40     | 4 (Crew 1-2)  | 2 Elements           | (O-3) Captain       |
| Squadron    | 20-1,280  | 8-64          | 2-8 Flights or Units | (O-4) Major         |
| Wing        | 40-3,840  | 16-192        | 2-3 Squadrons        | (O-5) Colonel       |
| Division    | 80-7,680  | 32-384        | 2 Wings              | (O-6) General       |
| *Air force* | *~12,800* | *~528*        | The entire air force | (O-7) Air Marshal                    |

In addition to the regular forces, there are two flights patrolling the airspace as for early warning threat detection and approximately 1,200 civilians tasked with supplying and maintaining the Air Force branch.

### Navy

The Navy branch of the Risky Witches is split into three sections.

The Surface section is comprised of two fleets, a close range assault force including the flagship aircraft carrier "Kestrel", and a long range strike force including the flagship aircraft carrier "Intervención".

The Submarine section is comprised of two fleets, a naval superiority force including the flagship submarine "Ghost Eater", and a classified long range reconnaissance force.

The Auxiliary section is comprised of three fleets, a rescue and patrol force, a long range support and transport force, and a classified special operations force.

| Unit name | Personnel  | Vessels                      | Subordinate units          | Officer in command  |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Element   | 18-105     | 1 vessel                     | ---                        | (O-1) Captain       |
| Task Unit | 18-420     | 1-4 small vessels            | 1-4 Elements               | (O-2) Lieutenant    |
| Squadron  | 36-8,400   | 2-20 small to medium vessels | 2-5 Task Units             | (O-3) Commander     |
| Division  | 72-36,700  | 4-80 small to large vessels  | 2-4 Squadrons              | (O-4) Rear Admiral  |
| Fleet     | 144-78,300 | 8-160 vessels + 1 flagship   | 2-4 Divisions              | (O-5) Admiral       |
| Command   | ---        | ---                          | Every Fleet in the section | (O-6) Grand Admiral |
| *Navy*    | *~51,130*  | *~203 vessels*               | The entire navy            | (O-7) Sea Marshal                    |

In addition to the regular forces, there is an elite combined arms regiment of 2,800 soldiers permanently garrisoned in Presidio de Tiburón as guard, and approximately 1,900 civilians tasked with supplying and maintaining the Navy branch.

### Special forces

The Special Forces branch of the Risky Witches is comprised of the hand picked elite from all three combat divisions, dedicated entirely to irregular warfare and high priority target recovery. Much of this branch is classified. They number approximately 3,600 personnel and supply their own equipment, including aircraft, but rely on the special operations fleet for naval operations. The branch is also home to two unique divisions.

Task Force 1743, Irregular Security (ISEC) is a unit classified as top secret, known by name only to all but a select handful of high ranking individuals. Their influence is global, and as such their numbers are impossible to ascertain. They operate in the shadows, outside of international law, and always accomplish their mission no matter the cost. Nothing is off limits for them.

Task Force 5555, "Party Regiment" is an all weather, day and night shock unit comprised of the pinnacle of the elite, trained for absolute superiority both on the ground and in the air, led personally by Freya and the [[Incarnations]]. While the unit is technically classified to prevent vital information from leaking, this unit is well known to all of the Risky Witches and is a huge morale booster. Part of the nickname comes from that fact, as simply hearing that the unit is joining the battle causes effective allied strength to surge. The other reason for the nickname is from the extreme freedom enjoyed within this unit, leading to a lot of highly unprofessional activity, like wild parties.

They have their own dedicated armory and a large, extremely varied aircraft inventory, all sporting distinctive paint jobs, and none of which is counted in their official statistics. They number 328 personnel, and all but three of them have both [[Alignment|alignment]] and attunement. The exceptions are Garm and Kuhai for not having alignment, and (Nameless Old Guy) for having neither.

### Non-combatants

To keep the Risky Witches functioning, a number of non-combat roles are essential. There are approximately 8,500 non-combatants spread as needed through six distinct departments. Some combat mission orders come from these departments, be it for defense, conflict resolution, hired support, or otherwise.
**Internal Affairs**: Tasked with top level administration and governance, including legislation and economics. 
**Political Affairs**: Tasked with negotiation and diplomacy with foreign powers and private companies as needed. 
**Supply Chain Management**: Tasked with everything related to the supply chain, including buying and selling. 
**Intelligence**: Tasked with acquiring, managing, archiving, and distributing intelligence as needed. 
**Espionage**: A classified department tasked with subterfuge, blackmail, and acquiring high value intelligence. 
**Cyber Ops**: A classified department dedicated to cybersecurity, cyber warfare, and providing services for hire.

## Public Agenda

Shortly after being declared terrorists by the reformed Destrean government in 1991, the Risky Witches formally established themselves in the international community as the Revolutionary State of Espada by coming forward with this agenda.   

- To become independent from the tyranny of Destrea, by any means necessary.
- To protect all spirits anywhere in the world, no matter the consequences.
- To protect all marginalized humans in the world, no matter the consequences.
- To never kill even one innocent person, no matter what the operation may be.
- To crush all who oppose us, and all those who oppose our allies.

While the organization at large rallies under this agenda and the international community accepts it, Freya herself has little interest in independence. To her, the organization is her tool to further her own goals, protect the world as a whole by preventing devastating attacks and war crimes before they happen, and indulge in violence for fun and profit.

## Assets

They hold control over the whole state of Espada, as well as Presidio de Tiburón in the state of Nalano. Their armaments, while mostly bought or taken from Ustonia and Destrea, are a mixture of things from every country, especially among the Special Forces division where soldiers and pilots are given extra freedom to choose their preferred loadouts.

The majority of their armaments are two or three generations behind current, with small portions of both newer and older technology mixed in. They also have an in-house weapons manufacturing plant, world renowned gunsmiths, and expert aircraft engineers and mechanics. Chances are if you can imagine it, they probably have it, and if they don't have it, they can make it for the right price.

## History

The Risky Witches began to form in 1981, originally a multirole fighter squadron in the Destrean air force commanded by Freya, known as the [[Witch Squadron]]. Their flying prowess combined with Destrean affiliation caused the Witch Squadron to slowly grow infamous, and their repeated insubordination caused the Destrean military to grow tired of their presence. Rather than disband the unit, its resources were quietly reallocated and the unit was sent into increasingly dangerous operations.

They lost several pilots, including Freya herself who was shot down over enemy territory and could not eject. Before impact, she ordered her squadron to withdraw, after which they were swiftly grounded by the wing commander. Having grown rather close, the surviving members of the Witch Squadron mourned Freya, but days later she walked into the dormitory wielding a revolver, shot the supervisor in front of her squad mates, and deserted with them. Word spread quickly and their infamy grew explosively.

Just one year later, now calling themselves the Witchblades, a group of guerrillas, their numbers ballooned as Freya's actions inspired many more to desert Destrea.

During a planned ambush on a Destrean transport, a young Garm was found being used as a living weapon. She was recovered alive during the ambush and immediately became attached to Freya. She was only 9 years old, and having seen the horrific way she was being treated, the group mindset began to shift away from empty vengeance to a common purpose. Freya took advantage of this and withdrew the Witchblades from active combat, switching the focus to recruiting more deserters in preparation for what she would only call "the big event."

Garm was raised to adulthood in the company of Freya and the Witchblades, who treated her warmly like their own family. During this time, Freya was also seizing every opportunity to track down Dvalinn, Haida, Kuhai, and Neven, and Destrean soldiers continued to desert. Desertions by spirits and people with attunement also skyrocketed.

In late 1990, Destrea got a new commander in chief, and with him came a new policy. Spirits showing "signs of rebellion" were to be executed without trial. This was not what Freya expected "the big event" to be, so there was a change of plans. She rallied the Witchblades around the idea of rebellion, began ordering detachments of her newfound army to specific strategic locations around the country, and told them all to expect further orders at the end of the year. Upon hearing her plan, Garm commented about how risky it is to spread the forces so thin, which inadvertently led to the new name of the group. But the move was calculated. Public opinion of the new regime was extremely low, so much that rebellion was on the minds of many already, making it significantly easier to move undetected.

At the turn of the new year in 1991, just as the holiday fireworks started, a surprise coup was staged against Destrea with frightening efficiency, hijacking the news coverage of the new year celebration and broadcasting the attacks nationwide. Government officials with any connection to the commander in chief were killed all across the country, the Destrean military was severely weakened, and a large number of weapons and aircraft were stolen.

After only 39 minutes, all high ranking individuals of the new regime were dead except for the commander in chief himself. Freya personally led the operation to storm his villa with a hostage news crew forced to follow and broadcast the whole operation. By the time they reached his room, this broadcast was on every national news network. When they broke down his door, Freya was shot eight times in the chest and twice in the head. The camera only had a glimpse of her in frame, but it was enough to see she was still standing. She then shot the commander in chief once in the throat, and after lingering on his dying body for a couple of seconds, the camera was turned towards Freya's remaining allies, now revealed to all be spirits. One of the men then stepped forward and gave a rallying speech, followed by a warning to residents of the state of Espada to evacuate and make room for the Risky Witches. After that, the broadcast was cut and the crew was released unharmed.

After that event, Destrea fell into civil war between the revolutionaries and conservatives. The revolutionaries grew exponentially in fervor as every one killed was seen as a martyr, especially once they learned that the coup caused no civilian casualties.

At the same time, the Risky Witches all converged on the state of Espada at full strength, and after two days of fighting, seized control of the entire state and annexed a fortified city. After flushing everybody out of the city and claiming it fully as Risky Witches property, it was deemed Presidio de la Bruja and celebrations erupted for days on end. As the civil war raged outside, the revolutionaries continued to dwindle, and the international community was still trying to make sense of the events.

The Risky Witches elected not to take control of Destrea as they preferred to separate, and after two weeks of reeling, the conservative faction installed a new commander in chief, who declared the Risky Witches to be terrorists and swore that they would be wiped out. The Risky Witches fired back, playfully challenging the Destrean regime to tell the world how many civilians they've killed, then revealed documentation and video evidence showing that the Risky Witches have killed none. After that, the international community largely decided to turn a blind eye to the coup and the Risky Witches, while the global opinion of Destrea plummeted. The civil war still rages to this day.

## Foreign relations

As a paramilitary group not officially recognized as a state or nation, foreign relations take on a unique tone with the Risky Witches as leaders and diplomats fear the potential implications of relations with them. Most contact is handled unofficially as a result, perpetuating a "don't ask, don't tell" attitude regarding the Risky Witches in the international community.

**[[Alastor]]**
Shortly after their establishment in 1991, the Risky Witches issued an international statement swearing to defend Alastor from all threats under any circumstances. In return, the Risky Witches are the only foreign entity allowed to pass freely through Alastor territory as they please, and Alastor provides them whatever support they can offer as needed.

**[[Corstaea]]**
Corstaea remains neutral towards the Risky Witches, having no need for their services and no reason to offer them support. The feeling is mutual.

**Destrea**
Obviously, they are sworn enemies. There is no repairing the relationship between the Risky Witches and Destrea, not without a total revolution by the Destrean people.

**[[Grenneria]]**
Grenneria is of the opinion that the Risky Witches are terrorists, but isn't brave enough to publicly denounce them. Relations are very passive aggressive as a result.

**[[Ilmaria]]**
While Ilmaria has turned a blind eye to the Risky Witches, the Risky Witches have a keen interest in Ilmaria as an enemy. They just need an excuse to attack.

**[[Osun Tanum]]**
Osun Tanum is cautious towards the Risky Witches, but fully support their goal of independence. The Risky Witches are cautiously optimistic regarding Osun Tanum as they are in full support of their policies and cultural treatment towards spirits and those with attunement, but neither offers services nor accepts support from them due to the possible consequences for Osun Tanum.

**[[Sangyon]]**
Sangyon is very wary of the Risky Witches because they know their military strength cannot compare. However, the Risky Witches have no issue with Sangyon and regularly offer their services.

**[[Shaohou]]**
Shaohou, as a friend to Destrea, shares their hostile opinion against the Risky Witches, but not quite to the same degree. Relations are still possible between the two, though under extreme tension.

**[[Shinzen]]**
Shinzen has a very negative opinion of the Risky Witches as they are highly opposed to war. However, the Risky Witches have no issue with Shinzen, so tensions may be high but they amount to nothing.

**[[Ustonia]]**
As Ustonia had negative relations with Destrea already, they seized an opportunity when the Risky Witches formed and formed a pact. Ustonia provides the Risky Witches with supplies and arms regularly in return for a heavy discount on their services and mutual defense when called for.
