Hijiya Tower is a 300 meter (984 foot) tall skyscraper with 62 above-ground floors located in the [[Asakawa]] area of [[City of Hashiri]] in [[Sumitori]], [[Shinzen]]. It is the headquarters of the [[Hijiya Corporation]], and is primarily dedicated to the operation of the company, with only two floors open to the public without special permission.

The first floor is a large store with a modest selection of most Hijiya products small enough to fit on a shelf, alongside a number of kiosks used to place orders for other products or services, and the second floor is dedicated to the public-facing aspects of Hijiya's finance businesses, including a large commercial bank and insurance offices. Every ten floors above that require progressively higher security clearance within the company, plus one more level of clearance for the top two floors. There are also five subterranean levels, the first being an employee parking garage, the second requiring the same level of clearance as the top two floors, and the remaining three requiring the highest clearance within the company. These floors are only accessible through a guarded elevator and stairwell starting on the third floor.
