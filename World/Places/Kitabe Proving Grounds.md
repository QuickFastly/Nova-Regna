Kitabe Proving Grounds was a large automotive testing compound, primarily focused on testing the top speeds of high-performance vehicles, as well as their handling characteristics, endurance, and stability at high speeds. It is located in the [[Kitabe]] area of [[Hashiri]] in [[Sumitori]], [[Shinzen]], built near the coastline and surrounded by hills on all other sides to reduce noise pollution. It was also previously a popular location for motorsport events before its closure. It was recently reopened by [[Haruna Kitami]] and [[EXCEED]], and has become the central point of the revival of traditional motorsport and automotive performance.

The primary feature of the compound is the massive four-lane oval constructed in the same manner as the nation's expressways, featuring two 1.5 kilometer (0.93 mile) long straight sections with extremely high banked turns, reaching a maximum banking of 33Â°. The total length of the oval is 4.5 kilometers (2.8 miles). This road is surrounded with high walls and steel catch fencing, both for safety reasons and to help further reduce noise pollution in the surrounding area. On the inside of one of the straight sections is a 1 kilometer (0.62 mi) long pit road lined with garages and workshops.

Contained within the oval is a complex network of interconnected racetracks that can be split into many different race layouts with cones and traffic barriers. There are four separate pit roads of varying lengths lined with garages and workshops in different locations to ensure that every possible track layout has at least one pit road accessible. Service roads weave between these tracks to allow access to every garage without needing to cross the track, even going underground at one point, and passing over another section. These service roads also connect to the entrance to the compound, which is a small two-lane tunnel underneath the oval. There is even a short dirt track on one end of the compound.

> These images are from Cities Skylines and aren't very good, but it definitely gets the point across. The banked corners aren't shown, there is almost no elevation change anywhere on the inner tracks, and the entrance tunnel is shown as a bridge instead. Eventually a better map will be made.
