The [[Hijiya Corporation]] EVA (Envirovoltaic Armature) Driver is an extremely compact circular device capable of generating incredible amounts of electricity indefinitely, with no fuel consumption or routine maintenance required.

These devices come in several different sizes and profiles to suit a variety of needs, ranging from the size of a large apple to the size of a small diode. The vast majority of them are sold to OEMs or other large companies, but a small direct-to-customer market exists for individuals to allow people to replace their own drivers, retrofit equipment with drivers using premade kits, or just tinker.

They are constructed with proprietary materials - a closely guarded secret of the company - and appear somewhat similar to an electric motor, with an obvious difference being the single monolithic coil winding rather than the multiple windings of a motor. The major components of an EVA Driver are the outer housing, inner chassis, envirovoltaic cells, superconduction ring, stator coil, controller module, and rotor assembly. There is also an array of supercapacitors inside the chassis, the size, number, and arrangement of which depends on the size of the driver.

The EV cells draw in [[Mystic Matter]] from the environment and convert it to electromotive force, which passes directly through the superconduction ring and into the stator coil. The controller module passively forces the EMF to travel through the coil in a clockwise rotation, which then turns the rotor assembly. Power from the rotor assembly is then sent back to the controller module to activate it, which then activates the superconduction ring to lower the temperature of the stator coil until superconductivity is achieved, eliminating nearly all friction and resistance. Once this process is complete, power output increases by orders of magnitude as the speed of the rotor reaches up to 12,000,000 RPM (if it is standard size). The controller module then regulates output using an advanced onboard AI, and can be pressed to manually toggle the superconduction ring, held to lock the rotor in place and halt power generation, or lifted and removed for an emergency abort.

The onboard AI sends regular telemetry to Hijiya at all times as a safety measure. A failing device, be it from a malfunction or due to tampering, carries catastrophic risks, so Hijiya maintains a group of contractors to collect any drivers that broadcast a red flag for any reason, including improper shutdowns. These contractors are colloquially known as "redbacks" due to their unnerving tactics and behavior, their outfits almost always incorporating the color red, and the red color of their identification.
