The Global Space Platform (GSP) is the largest modular space station currently in low [[Earth]] orbit. It is a multinational collaborative project involving the national space agencies of [[Osun Tanum]], [[Ustonia]], [[Shinzen]], and [[Sangyon]]. The ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements. The station serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which scientific research is conducted in astrobiology, astronomy, meteorology, physics, [[Mystic Matter|mystic matter]], and other fields.

The station is divided into three sections: the Ozen Orbital Segment (OOS) operated by Osun Tanum, the Ustonian Orbital Segment (UOS) operated by Ustonia, and the Avangian Orbital Segment (AOS) operated by Shinzen. The UOS includes six modules, the AOS includes seven modules, and the OOS includes 16 modules.
