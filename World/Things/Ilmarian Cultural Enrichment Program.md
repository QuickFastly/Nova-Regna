The [[Ilmaria|Ilmarian]] Cultural Enrichment Program (CEP) is an incentive designed to attract entrepreneurs, artists, public figures, and other culturally or economically notable people from [[Ustonia]] and [[Shinzen]] to move to Ilmaria, specifically to [[Ventura]]. Accepted applicants are immediately given a permanent residence visa with a fast-track to citizenship as an option, along with discounted rent and/or property taxes for as long as they remain in the program. Accepted applicants that earn less than the median annual income of Ventura are also offered monthly cash deposits to raise their annual income to the median level for as long as they remain in the program.

One of the conditions of the program is that applicants must share a residence with at least one person from the other country, so each CEP residence will always have at least one Ustonian and at least one Shinzenese resident. If an applicant decides to leave this arrangement, their visa will not be revoked, but the financial incentives will cease.

Applicants are all allowed to directly choose one person from their own country to move in with them, but beyond that, all applicants are matched together by a black box algorithm managed by [[11K]].
