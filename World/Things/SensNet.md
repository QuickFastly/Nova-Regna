SensNet is a lifestyle technology product introduced in Q2 2016 by [[11K]] that functions through a direct two-way neural interface with an always-on internet connection regardless of location with no need for any external power source, and has both augmented reality and virtual reality capabilities. Since the completion of the [[Avalon]] data center, the SensNet interface is also used to provide access to [[Sublimation|sublimation]].

In Q1 2029, 11K removed the purchase price for SensNet and launched a global distribution and installation initiative, with the stated aim of connecting every person alive with the SensNet service. Today, all citizens of [[Ilmaria]] are required by law to have SensNet devices, and over 80% of people in the rest of the world have had SensNet devices installed so far.

## How it works

The SensNet device is installed on the back of the neck and connects directly to the brain and nervous system. Through this connection, it provides users with similar functionality to computers and smartphones by projecting audiovisual content directly into the users senses and reading user input either through physical gestures or thought commands. By default, information is presented through augmented reality as though there are intangible "screens" within the user's field of view that require pseudo-physical interaction. Many of these projections are synchronized with all SensNet users, allowing people to see what others are doing to a degree, or for users to share content with others easily. Individual users can choose to disable this function, and can fully customize their experience.

The device can also use the senses of the user to record video of their surroundings as they perceive them, create a projection of the user's face and body that can be used in video communications with other users without need for an external camera, provide neural guidance to artificially enhance the user's skill with certain tasks or be used as a learning tool, and more.

The device is powered primarily by four redundant power cells, but also receives residual power from the nervous system. Each power cell is rated to last five to eight years. Four are present even though only one is needed due to the way the SensNet device is installed, as a complete loss of power to the device would result in the user losing all neural function outside of the brain itself. Should all four power cells cease functioning, the residual power from the nervous system is enough only to maintain the user's regular neural function and send an emergency signal to 11K so that the power cells may be replaced by local emergency services as soon as possible.

The virtual reality functionality of SensNet fully intercepts all of the user's sensory signals, effectively placing users fully inside of an avatar in a virtual world. Due to the immense complexity of programming software to be aware of an entire brain, very few games and other experiences exist for this platform, but those that do are immensely popular. Users are required to lie on their backs before this functionality can be used to prevent injury.

Sublimation is an extension of the virtual reality functionality, utilizing the direct connection to digitally replicate the unique consciousness of a given user and allow it to persist within a digital avatar after the death of the user's physical body.

The center of the device is a cylindrical module that can be swapped out for other modules with different functionality at the user's choice. The module included by default with every installation has three card slots so that the user may expand the storage of the device, share data with other users by swapping cards, or use multiple device profiles by swapping cards. Other modules offered by 11K include radio modules, security modules, computer interfaces, and more, all of which also include at least one card slot. Removing the module also allows the user to directly connect their brains to external devices through the use of a two-way 93 pin cable.

### Installation

The SensNet device is installed over a two day process, though nearly all of this time is simply the recovery period after the surgical procedure.

The procedure begins by placing the user under general anesthesia, then rolling them onto their stomach. Using a surgical robot, a circular hole of 24 millimeter diameter is then opened in the back of the user's neck, where the core of the SensNet device is then pressed in until it makes contact with the spinal cord. Four power cell receptacles are then inserted around the perimeter of the core, before the flexible face plate of the device is placed over the area and surgically attached to the skin. The power cells are then inserted and the device powered on, at which point the spinal cord is automatically severed and each end connected directly to the SensNet core. The final step of the procedure is the insertion of a syringe through the core and the injection of a nanomachine cluster that closes and seals the hole the syringe was inserted from before connecting the 93 pins of the device's connector to the correct parts of the spinal cord, then begins working through the body and creating connections between the SensNet core and every single nerve in the body and neuron in the brain with cables no thicker than one nanometer.

The user is then moved to a hospital bed and woken up, spending the next two days laying down and recovering from the procedure. In the first hour awake, the user will experience extreme difficulty moving any part of their body other than their face. Once their motor functions begin to return in the next two to three hours, they will experience a lack of coordination and balance that will recover over the course of approximately 12 hours. Typically, this recovery finishes either in the user's sleep, or before they go to sleep at all. The second day of their stay in the hospital bed is simply to ensure their safety as the nanomachines are flushed from the body.

Installation of SensNet is permanent and irreversible. The device can be deactivated, but it cannot be removed from the body due to its deep integration with the host nervous system.

## Reception

Public reception of SensNet when it was first announced was skeptical and mixed, especially surrounding the installation procedure, but reception quickly became positive once the devices made their way into public hands, with most people believing that they could not imaging returning to a life without the product.

A significant minority of skeptics remained consistently prominent around the world, and over time, slowly grew in numbers. Skeptics primarily cite concerns regarding the always-online internet connection that users cannot control, the closed black-box nature of the software, and the centralization of all personal and identifying information in 11K servers.

In a particularly high profile case of criticism and rejection, the [[Children of the Flame]] officially banned its members from having SensNet devices installed, claiming that the technology is an insult to the gods and its users will not be spared on the day of reckoning.

Regardless of the criticism and skepticism, the overwhelming majority of people now believe that SensNet is the most important technological advancement yet in living memory, with some even going so far to claim that SensNet is the first step towards the next phase of human evolution.
