It's hard to build a world with no influence from reality at all. So I didn't. Everything in [[Earth|this world]] is influenced heavily by various parts of the real world, and it's no secret. If you want to create something new for the world and you want to know where to look for inspiration, this page is here to place influences on the map politically, as well as for the [[Cultures & Ethnicities]] of the world.

> [!warning]
> It is important to keep in mind that just because all these people and places are based heavily on the real world, they are still *fictional*. A lot of real-world history does not exist here, and a lot of creative liberty must be taken. Original ideas are just as important as the real-world sources, this page only serves to list sources of *influence*, not of 1-to-1 recreations.
> 
> Some cultural stereotypes may also be written to quickly convey a theme in a simple way, but they are under no circumstances to be portrayed as derogatory or at the expense of others, nor is that ever the intention, so while you should not take them overly seriously or read too deeply into them if/where they are present, please contribute suggestions and reasoning for improvements if you have any.

- [[Corstaea]] represents Norway, Finland, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Ireland.
	- [[Carlow]] specifically represents the Celtic nations.
	- [[Tolred]] was once a Grennerian colony before being claimed by Corstaea, leading to a unique mixture of Finnish and Russian culture in much of the modern populace. The indigenous people of Tolred, however, represent the Greenlandic Inuit.
	- Finland is represented in southern Tolred and northern [[Vallastad]], and Norway in the rest of Vallastad, [[Torstrøm]], and [[Halstrand]].
	- The island of [[Jomsgård]] specifically represents Iceland.
	- [[Sarrac]] is an autonomous territory representing the Faroe Islands.
	- Germany is represented in [[Affolstein]], [[Hartmond]], and most of [[Allenthal]].
	- Finally, the non-Celtic parts of the United Kingdom (pretty much just England) are represented in [[Vinesse]], [[Manden]], and northeastern Allenthal.
- [[Destrea]] primarily represents Italy and Spain, but also Mexico, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Cuba, Jamaica, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Brazil.
	- The group of islands off the southern coast of the country specifically represent Micronesia and Melanesia. None of the many cultures found on those islands are officially recognized by Destrea, and they are largely left alone today, but were the primary source of people for the slave trade in early history.
	- Jamaica, Haiti, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic are all represented in what is now [[Selva Luce]]. Before the formation of Destrea, Selva Luce was four separate nations and had more land. Tensions are extremely high here as Destrean oppression is slowly eroding their cultures, which are not officially recognized as separate by the government.
	- Italy is represented primarily in [[Vaceniza]], with Rome being mirrored by the city of [[Alessa]]. All roads in Destrea and much of Ustonia eventually lead there. [[Begliano]], [[Nalano]], and [[Mugenno]] also represent primarily Italian culture.
	- Spain is represented primarily in [[Savorra]], but also extends through [[Alcaras]], northern [[Filimeni]], and eastern [[Casezzo]].
	- Mexico is represented in Destrea by the western regions of [[Tarence]] and Casezzo, and extends into Ustonia. More on that in the Ustonia section below.
	- All Destrean prefectures were once sovereign nations with their own territories, which is how so many different real-world cultures are prominent in this country. Everything that hasn't been specifically named above - including additional Latin American cultures - can be anywhere in small numbers, and that will develop over time, but Italian culture is strong throughout most of the south, and Spanish in the north.
	- While the many unique cultures are prominent and celebrated by the people to this day, the country is now *politically* most similar to fascist Italy.
- [[Grenneria]] represents primarily Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Czech Republic, Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Belarus, Latvia, and Romania.
	- [[Khotka]], however, represents Portugal and Galicia. It was first settled by people from what is now Destrea and developed independently very early in history, before being taken by Grenneria much later. There is notable Romanian influence, but the Portuguese and Galician cultures remain intact and dominant.
	- Romania is represented specifically by [[Nazavat]].
	- Ukraine is represented specifically by [[Ulavyr]].
	- [[Roslaya]] primarily represents Russia, and the whole country is primarily Russian in political style and influence. 
	- Polish and Czech culture are both represented primarily in [[Kielda]].
	- Croatian and Slovene culture are both represented primarily in [[Sarabey]].
	- Serbian and Bulgarian culture are both represented primarily in [[Markask]].
	- Belarusian and Latvian culture are both represented primarily in [[Ivashni]].
	- Other Slavic cultures may also be placed throughout the country in small numbers, but exactly which and where they are will develop over time.
- [[Osun Tanum]] primarily represents Sweden, while also representing Denmark, Austria, Belgium, Netherlands, and Hungary.
	- Hungary is represented almost exclusively in the southeast region of [[Elgård]], Austria in [[Vastdal]], Belgium in [[Macdon]], and Netherlands in [[Osterfeld]].
	- While the culture is dominantly Swedish throughout the country, Danish culture mixes in more and more the farther south you go.
	- Of the eight large countries, this one has the most fictional aspects to it, explaining Osun Tanum's near-utopian government and society.
- [[Sangyon]] primarily represents South Korea, while also representing Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines.
	- Singapore is specifically represented in [[Tanje]], Thailand in [[Tanbaek]], Indonesia in [[Jeonsan]], and the Philippines in [[Cheosu]]. South Korean influence is present in all of them.
	- The northwest corner of this country - mainly [[Rasan]] and [[Ranan]] - was also settled by Corstaean people early in history, and includes a small but notable mixture of Norwegian culture as a result.
	- Since Shinzen was once an empire that ruled over this entire country, some Japanese influence on the culture is still present in small ways.
- [[Shaohou]] primarily represents China, while also representing Mongolia, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Malaysia.
	- Malaysia is represented exclusively in [[Suwei]], and Vietnam in [[Xinwei]]. Mongolian and Cambodian culture and people are spread thin throughout all of Shaohou.
	- Unlike China, the Han people are not the overwhelming majority of Shaohou. They are still the majority, but there is a lot more diversity throughout the country.
	- Since Shinzen was once an empire that ruled over this entire country, some Japanese influence on the culture is still present in small ways.
- [[Shinzen]] primarily represents Japan, while also representing Taiwan and Hong Kong.
	- Taiwan is specifically represented by [[Futou]], and Hong Kong by [[Onsai]]. These states were part of Shaohou until relatively recently, so Japanese influence on these states is minimal, but present.
	- The Ainu people are indigenous to and represented mainly in [[Tozawa]] with some presence in the south of [[Sumitori]] as well. They are much more prominent here than in reality, but are still a very small and fractured minority.
	- The Ryukyuan people are indigenous to and represented mainly in [[Okina]] with some presence in the south of Sumitori as well. Unlike reality, they are officially recognized and were not subject to cultural suppression by Shinzen.
	- All of the [regions of Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_Japan) have a specific place here. [[Kiyoshiri]] represents Kyūshū (with Satsuma retaining particular prominence), [[Kenshiri]] represents Shikoku, [[Hayagawa]] represents Chūgoku, Sumitori represents Kansai, Tozawa represents Hokkaidō, Okina represents the Ryukyu islands, [[Asahi]] represents Kantō, [[Kuminachi]] represents Tōhoku, and [[Miwae]] represents Chūbu.
	- One major difference from these regions, however, is that the city and culture of Kyoto is represented by [[Soukotan]] in Miwae, rather than in Sumitori with the rest of the Kansai region.
	- Additionally, the Hayato people are represented in Kiyoshiri, and the Azumi people in Kenshiri, even though both were from Kyūshū, and the many dialects of Japanese are represented here more by ethnicity than by region. More on that on the [[Shisuya]] page.
- [[Ustonia]] primarily represents the USA, while also representing Canada, Australia, and Polynesia.
	- [[Isla Sofia]] is a completely self sustained island that specifically represents Polynesia, most prominently Māori people. Its name comes from Destrean colonization attempts, and Ustonia chose to use that name when annexing the land. The native name of the land is unknown (or TBD).
	- Canada is represented almost exclusively in [[Lonfolk]], [[Exford]], and [[Norston]], while [[South Macdon]] is primarily Belgian with some Canadian influence.
	- Similarly, [[West Vastdal]] is primarily Austrian with some Australian influence.
	- Australia is represented almost exclusively in [[Morwick]], [[Oxbalt]], and [[Corburn]].
	- [[Prestona]] and [[Verace]], having recently defected from Destrea, have dominant Mexican culture not found anywhere else in Ustonia.
	- Ustonia, as you may be able to guess, is a colonized nation. While representing the named countries, it also prominently represents the indigenous peoples of them as minority groups, many with their own reservations. All of these indigenous cultures can be anywhere, and that will develop over time.

[[Alastor]] and [[Ilmaria]] are the only completely fictional locations on the map with no major real-world connections of their own, albeit still influenced in part by the people that live there - Icelandic and Danish for Alastor, Japanese and American for Ilmaria.

Some particularly important differences from reality to consider with your influences are:
- Some of the real-world countries represented by Destrea have ties with the EU, but the closest equivalent in this world is the [[Ozen Federation]], which Destrea is not a part of. Any multinational EU projects you would like to reference should instead be part of the Ozen Federation. Destrea could still be a customer for these programs though.
	- For example, the Eurofighter Typhoon would be a product of the Ozen Federation in this world, and Destrea would play no part in that program, even though Spain and Italy are project managers for it in the real world.
- This world had its Nazi Germany-esque event in its history, and Germany is represented in Corstaea. However, in this world, that event and all the weird technology that came with it happened in Destrea instead.
- France isn't really represented anywhere in this world, but French technological developments should be treated as Destrean in this world.
- Unlike reality, where much of east Asia migrated from what is now China, the people of Sangyon, Shaohou, and Shinzen are all native to their lands. There is also no Chinese influence outside of Shaohou, Futou, and Onsai, but there *is* some Japanese influence throughout the continent due to empire of Shinzen ruling over the entire continent for a time.
- Grenneria may represent Russia in part, but Grenneria has a floundering aviation sector. Shinzen, meanwhile, is dominant in this field. As such, major Russian aviation companies (Sukhoi, Mikoyan, Ilyushin, Irkut, Tupolev, Yakovlev,) should instead be considered part of Shinzen.
- When it comes to brand names, you can use real-world ones for convenience, as long as you use a [[Meta admonition]] to state that you're doing so. All real-world brand names must be fictionalized in all canon in-world content, so any real-world names will only ever exist on this wiki as points of reference. Check and use the [[List of fictionalized real-world brand names]].

Linguistically, global development in this world should be considered greatly simplified due to the smaller overall population and higher population density, despite cultural development remaining (somewhat) realistically diverse. In fact, the linguistic development of this world is extremely *un*realistic when compared to reality, considering that many of the languages located near each other geographically have quite little in common linguistically, but that could be thanks at least in part to those pesky gods meddling in people's affairs[^1], so I think that's fine. More on handling languages can be read [[On the languages of the world|here]].

Culturally, I'm fully aware that there are a lot of real-world cultures not mentioned here - *most of the planet* has been left out! - and that there's a lot more detail that could be expanded from what has been mentioned above. This combined with the extremely limited number of major ethnic groups in this world is a conscious decision in an effort to keep the scope of the world manageable, so it should be theoretically possible for anyone to learn the essentials of almost everything about it in a day or two, even as the world grows.

Don't let that stop you from adding representation for more real-world cultures and ethnicities! That would be a very welcome addition! Just keep the above in mind if you do that. Try to write new cultures or ethnicities as minority subgroups within an existing larger group, or provide detailed history on their origins plus when and how/why they became a minority. Creating a new major group with greater numbers isn't entirely off the table, but will require a strong case to consider the myriad potential effects throughout the history of the world.

Also, since there isn't currently a more suitable place to put this note, all animals that exist in the real world exist in this world too. Some that have gone extinct in the real world may not be extinct here, and vice versa. It's also entirely possible to create completely original creatures that don't exist in the real world, as long as they're relatively believable, and in fact some original creatures would be pretty cool since there are so many possibilities for how mystic matter could affect animals in this world.

[^1]: If you're no fun and you really want to know what they did, this is the footnote for you, but it might be more fun if you stop reading it now. Anyway, everything that the various pages in the cultures and ethnicities section say is "suggested" is true. It is also true that all the world's ethnicities come from the seven major groups, but several of the subgroups "thought to" be new developments did in fact exist since Era Dira, and Carlanders really are the first of the Exilans like they were "thought to" be, and the Farodet story of "emerging from the mountains" was spot on. The people who survived The End of Everything were sheltered within Himlavård, and then at the beginning of Anno Ortu, most of the people were teleported to their places around the world, but the Farodet, Exilan, and Irovell people walked out of the mountains themselves. Knowing all that, though, don't get used to the idea of things that are "thought to be" or "suggested" to be true *actually* being true, because some of the information on this wiki is deliberately incorrect due to being written from the human perspective without the knowledge of true events.
