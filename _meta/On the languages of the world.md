Until the day someone goes hog wild and creates a large handful of fictional languages just for this world, real-world languages will be used. However, this will be handled in a specific way.

**Languages shall not be named at any point in any stories set in this world, nor on any page of this wiki, *except those in the [[Cultures & Ethnicities]] section.***

Personally, I do want to define fictional languages for this world one day, but it's extremely low on my list of priorities. Using real-world etymology to create names for fictional people and places doesn't bother me, but despite that, I find it awkward and uncomfortable to use the real names of real-world languages in a fictional world with none of the same people, places, or development.

So, for example, rather than writing "Korean" anywhere, write "the Chiyan language" instead. Writing *in Korean*, however, is perfectly fine and welcomed. For that to make sense though, the Chiya pages in the Cultures and Ethnicities section will specify that their language is the same as Korean.

This applies absolutely on the wiki, and I strongly recommend that you follow this policy in any other content as well. Either that, or make your own language and make a page for it here too.
