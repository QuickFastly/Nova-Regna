In this world, there is [[Mystic Matter|mystic matter]] - a substance with supernatural properties on its own that can cause certain supernatural phenomena in the natural world - and characters with [[Attunement|attunement]] can manipulate it to perform all kinds of supernatural feats. One might even call it magic, who would have guessed?

If you want to write a character with this ability, you need to keep the following things in mind.

### Source of power

Attunement, as an ability, runs mainly on two things: The user's imagination, and their ability to think abstractly against logic and reason. This means that the type of "magic" a user is capable of is dependent in large part on their personality, and if anything, their *lack* of scientific knowledge. Their ability is a part of them, and may say a lot about them.

The reason having *less* knowledge may be beneficial to a user is because they will have less to think about, and therefore less logic to defy. On the other hand, extensive knowledge in a field of science could also influence the user's ability in its own way.

For instance, one person may develop a magnet-like ability if they studied magnets a lot and find themselves incapable of using it on anything that isn't naturally magnetic, while another person may develop a similar ability that they can use on all materials, magnetic or not, if they grew up uneducated on a farm.

It is extremely difficult, but not completely impossible, for a user to teach another their techniques and abilities. The main exception to this rule is by familial tradition, like the [[Inazuma Clan]] for example, but the *incredibly vast majority* of people with attunement will learn and develop entirely on their own.

The only other consideration for where this power comes from is that it's based on the manipulation of mystic matter, a physical substance that exists in the world. This ability doesn't create new matter, it reshapes existing mystic matter into what the user desires, or uses that mystic matter to perform otherwise impossible tasks.

Some areas of the world have higher or lower concentrations of this matter than normal, and that will have an effect on attunement users in those areas. Less proficient users may find themselves completely unable to use their abilities in particularly desolate regions.

Finally, an additional important consideration would be whether or not the user also has [[Alignment]]. Not all do, but someone without alignment is *far* less likely to ever discover their attunement, and it will be harder to learn.

Also remember that mystic matter itself is a very recent discovery in the world. If you plan to write anything that takes place before the late 20th century, everyone in the world will believe it's magic, and that might be taboo in some areas. Even for a while after the discovery, it took a while for the rest of the world to catch up and realize that it's not magic, and for the taboos to fade away.

### Elements

Many proficient users will find themselves developing an affinity for an "element" like fire, water, electricity, and so forth. This is NOT a functional mechanic. Let me repeat that.

**This world's "magic" is *NOT* elemental *AT ALL*.**

No "element" has an advantage over any other, because it's an illusion. These affinities are formed entirely within the users' imaginations and have no inherent function, it's just what each user finds easiest to understand, or finds most appealing.

Abandon all semblance of elemental magic systems or video game logic in your writing with this ability. You can be more creative than that.

Fire is often weak to water in media, but why doesn't the water evaporate?
Electricity is often weak to earth in media, but why doesn't the earth burn?
Dark is often weak to light in media, but what does that even mean?

All a user has to do in this world to overcome the idea of an elemental advantage is ask themselves *why*. The moment a user stops confidently and absolutely believing they have an advantage or disadvantage, it disappears.

Of course, to stop believing, they have to believe in the first place, and that kind of game logic doesn't really exist in this world, so nobody believes to begin with.

So, let me say it a third time just to be extra clear because I just hate this trope *that much.*

**There is *NO* elemental magic in this world. "Elements" are purely aesthetic.**

### Limitations & Possibilities

With elements out of the way and remembering that imagination is one of the main sources of power for this ability, it should be very clear that this ability is an opportunity to be super creative. The only limit is from the perspective of balance.

It's theoretically possible for a person to become more powerful than a god with this ability, but nobody does, *and nobody should,* because it would destroy the balance of power for the entire world.

The reason the [[Fox|fox spirits]] are the most proficient users of this ability is entirely because of how long they live. Even with a thousand years of practice, they still struggle to even come *close* to the powers of the [[Incarnations|incarnations]], because the incarnations *are the gods*.

How you limit your character's proficiency with their attunement is open to just as much creativity as the abilities you give them. Are they too highly educated to be able to get in the mindset? Do they overthink it and fizzle out? Are they simply not creative enough? Maybe they're neurodivergent and that makes it more (or maybe less!) difficult for them than for others.

Now with that in mind, let me remind you again that imagination is one of the main sources of power here. How a character utilizes their attunement doesn't have to be like magic, or even visible.

It could be used for psychic abilities, like limited foresight or psychometry. It could be used for communication, allowing a character to speak or read other languages without studying them, use telepathy, or communicate with animals. It could be used to slow the character's perception of time to give them faster reaction speeds. It could make them physically stronger without them even knowing why, or slow their aging slightly without them realizing.

Anything you can imagine, it can be done as long as you can make it believable and maintain some amount of balance.

Oh, by the way, stuff like ghosts? Haunted woods? That's all connected to mystic matter too in this world. It's exceedingly rare, but paranormal activity in the world can be justified with mystic matter. For instance, a ghost might be the soul of a person with attunement that remained alive after the person was murdered.

Of course, this implies that [[On the soul, living or otherwise|souls]] exist, and they do. Everyone has a soul, and it's made of mystic matter. The world is not aware of this.

Go wild with that one.

### Balance

And finally, the topic of balance. Attunement as an ability is inherently unbalanced, no matter how weak the character is. Even if all the character can do is move a pencil on a table without touching it, that's more than the vast majority of people are capable of. *Everything* this ability can do is a direct advantage.

So what is "balanced" then? Obviously one-on-one matchups against an attunement user will never be balanced, so you have to consider a larger scale. Can the character take on an army, head first? You've gone too far. Can they take on an armed squad of eight people, unarmed? Sure, if you can make it believable. Perhaps a more interesting *and* believable overpowered scenario, however, would be a character that utilizes supernatural eyesight and telepathy to control a battlefield from the background as a tactician.

You may have noticed that the word "believable" has been used a lot here. In the end, that's the most important thing for this ability. It doesn't have to be realistic, it doesn't have to be fair, it doesn't even have to make logical sense, as long as you can write it in a *believable* way in the context of this world. Make us believe that the character should be capable of what you say they are.

Expect your contributions with this ability to be reviewed on that more than anything else.

Don't overthink it I guess.
