To get a quick at-a-glance idea of the power balance between the countries of the world in the modern era, this chart exists. Of course there can be as much or as little additional nuance as you choose to think about, but this should get you on the right track no matter what.

The "other" section on this chart includes anything irregular. Private militaries, militias, espionage, whatever you can think of that doesn't fit army, navy, or air force.

What do the percentages mean? What are they relative to? How much is the difference between an A and an S grade? I don't know, it doesn't really matter, it's the vaguest possible graph, it's not made for detail.

If you look back more than about 110 years (from the current year of 2033 to the 1920s and earlier,) the major changes to consider are as follows:
- The Risky Witches does not exist prior to 1991
- Ilmaria does not exist prior to 1984
- The Ozen Federation does not exist prior to 1978
- Destrea and Ustonia are significantly weaker. The balance between them is the same, but the Ozen nations are able to fight back much more effectively
- Destrea and Ustonia get weaker and weaker as you go beyond the 1920s
- Destrea no longer exists past 1797
	- Instead, each of its prefectures are their own small nations, except for Selva Luce, which splits into four even smaller nations. These nations are all quite formidable, both in tactics and technology
- Ustonia no longer exists past 1706
	- Instead, the country is largely unincorporated with three major colonies around the place settled by people of Ozen. The colonies have formidable technology but rather weak tactics, and the many groups of indigenous people are the opposite
	- Go back another 60 or so years and the colonies no longer exist
- Go back to around the year 800 and three quarters of the Yulentian continent is owned by the Alessan Empire, which is the dominant global power of the time

Some other things:
- Corstaea and Osun Tanum may not have particularly strong militaries, but in the last 60-70 years, their technological advancements outpaced their own capabilities. Because of this, they frequently participate in weapon design competitions held by Ustonia or Shinzen, where said weapons may then be primarily manufactured.

Also here's a version of the current year foreign relations chart from all the country pages without any emphasis on any particular country, because I don't know where else to put it.
