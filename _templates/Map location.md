  <!-- Markdown and wikilinks don't work inside most html, and Obsidian also doesn't support relative file paths in html format, so this block is a separate <span> element to allow for a relative path wikilink to the image.

  <!-- Unlike every other infobox template, the artist credit and image license fields are not present here.

Anything else should go below this infobox, and you can add credits and disclosures there if needed -->
