<!-- If you want more stuff on the side beneath the info box, put it here. Use the following html tag:

 This will keep it in line with the info box.-->

Briefly describe what the organization is, what it does, and where it's located here. One to three paragraphs should be all you need up here.

This template is the most bare-bones of all the templates, by the way. Don't be afraid to add anything you can think of, and remove what you don't need.

## Structure

Describe in detail how the organization is structured and what the different parts of it do, and use as many subheadings as you want. More details, more better.

## Assets

What kind of stuff does the organization have? Products, weapons, land, anything in its possession that you think is notable.

You can use real-world brands and stuff here for convenience, just use a [[Meta admonition]] to state that you're doing so, because all real-world brands must be fictionalized in canon content. Check and use the [[List of fictionalized real-world brand names]].

## Public agenda

What are the organization's public facing goals and intentions? Remember, these articles should be written from the perspective of public knowledge inside this world, as though this were an in-world wiki intended for its people, so try not to write things the people aren't aware of. You can use admonitions or separate meta pages for that stuff if need be.

## History

What is the history of this organization? More details, more better. Unlike what the character and location templates say, try to keep all of the organization's history on this page, no matter how long it gets.
