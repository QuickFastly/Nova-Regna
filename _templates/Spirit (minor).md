Add a brief explanation of this spirit type, and their most basic non-physical identifying characteristics. Only two or three sentences should be needed here.

## History

Describe the history of these spirits in great detail. Ideally, you should not need any subheadings for this, only paragraphs.

## Anatomy & physiology

Pretty self explanatory. What makes these spirits different from humans?

### Life cycle

Even minor spirits may experience a different life cycle to humans, so describe it. Of course, this is optional and can be removed if this type of spirit shares the same life cycle as humans.

### Diet

If these spirits are serious oddballs, this field may be useful. It's only part of the template to make you aware that it can be used, but the majority of minor spirits should have no need for this.

## Geographic distribution

Where in the world are they? If they have specific reasons to stick to certain locations, explain that too.

## Sociology

If these spirits have, or once had a culture of their own, describe its aspects in detail here, such as customs, aesthetic ideals, or mythology. Also describe any notable social aspects they may have, such as gender, sexuality, familial, or economic ideals. Use as many subheadings as you want.

### Interracial relations

Pretty self explanatory. How do humans and other spirits view them, and vice versa?

## Trivia

Anything else you want to include about these spirits that doesn't really fit in any of the above headings can go here.
